Riot on the radio
Pictures on the TV
Invader man take what he can
 Shootout on the silver screen
Sticking them up and knocking them down
Living out a fantasy
 There is a bad man cruising around
In a big black limousine
Don't let it be wrong
Don't let it be right
Get in his way
You are dead in his sights


Big gun
Big gun number one
Big gun
 Big gun kick the hell out of you


 Terminators, Uzi makers
Shooting up Hollywood
 Snakes alive with a .45
Getting off and doing no good
If you are not wise they will cannibalise
Tear flesh off you
Classified lady killers
Praying in the human zoo
They saddle you up
And take you to town
Better look out
When he come around



 
Yeah
Show down
Ooooh yeah yeah
Ye yeah yeah




Big gun, got a hot one
Big gun, got a number one
Big gun, loaded and cocked
Big gun, hot hot hot
Got big gun, ready or not
Big gun, give it, give it a shot, come on


Terminator, Uzi makers
Regulators, going to get you later
Big gun kick the hell out of you
