Are you gonna take me home tonight
Oh down beside that red firelight
Are you gonna let it all hang out
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rockin' world go round


 I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
 But I knew life before I left my nursery
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Hey big woman you made a bad boy out of me


 I've been singing with my band
Across the wire, across the land
I seen every blue-eyed floozy on the way
But their beauty and their style
Went kind of smooth after a while
Take me to them lardy ladies every time
Come on


 Oh won't you take me home tonight
Oh down beside your red firelight
Oh and you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go round
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go round


Hey listen here
Now your mortgages and homes
I've got stiffness in my bones
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality
I tell you
Oh but I still get my pleasure
Still got my greatest treasure
Hey big woman you gonna make a big man of me
Now get this


 Are you gonna take me home tonight (please)
Oh down beside that red firelight
Are you gonna let it all hang out
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go round (yeah)
 Fat bottomed girls
You make the rocking world go round

 Get on your bikes and ride


Ooh yeah
