The sun shines
And people forget
The spray flies as the speedboat glides
 And people forget
Forget they are hiding
The girls smile
And people forget
 The snow packs as the skier tracks
And people forget
Forget they are hiding


 Behind an eminence front
Eminence front – It is a put on
Come on join the party
Dress to kill
Will not you come and join the party
Dress to kill


The drinks flow
People forget
That big wheel spins, the hair thins
People forget
Forget they are hiding
The news slows
People forget
The shares crash, hopes are dashed
People forget
Forget they are hiding


Behind an eminence front
Eminence front – it is a put on
 Come on join the party
Dress to
Come on join the party
Dress to
Come on join the party
Dress to
Come on join the party
Dress to kill
Dress yourself, dressed to kill
