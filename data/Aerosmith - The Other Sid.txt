Loving you has go to be (take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (take me to the other side)
Oh take me to the other side (take me to the other side)


My mamma told me there'd be days like this
And man, she wasn't fooling
Because I just can't believe the way you kiss
Uh uh huh
You opened up your mouth with baited breath
You said you'd never leave me
You love me, you hate me, I tried to take the loss
You're crying me a river but I got to get across




I'm looking for another kind of love
Oh Lordy, how I need it
The kind that likes to leap without a shove
Oh, honey, best believe it
To save a lot of time and foolish pride I'll say what's on my mind, girl
You loved me, you hate me, you cut me down to size
You blinded me with love and yeah it opened up my eyes




Take me to the other side
I'm looking for another kind of love
Oh Lordy, how I need it
The kind that likes to leap without a shove
Honey, best you believe it
Now I'm not one for saying long goodbyes
I hope all is forgiven
You loved me, you hate me, I used to be your lover
You know you had it coming girl so take me to the other
