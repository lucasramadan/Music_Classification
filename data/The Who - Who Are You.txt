I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said "You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away"
 I staggered back to the underground
 And the breeze blew back my hair
 I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair

 
Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)


I took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rolling Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin
I stretched back and I hiccupped
And looked back on my busy day
 Eleven hours in the Tin Pan
God, there's got to be another way
Who are you?
 Oh wa oh wa oh wa oh wa



 


I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
I only feel right on my knees
 I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?
