I got a 9 millimeter
Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
 Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gone make me reveal it ay


 Tool on deck, why would I lie?
 Nigga you a pussy, hope you got 9 lives
 I can hit a nigga with the 9, 9 times
 Country ass boy, country like LeAnn Rimes
Mississippi D-Banner and Lil Weezyana
 Everybody got tools so you will need a hammer
 I'm a pill poppin' animal, syrup sippin' nigga
 I'm so high you couldn't reach me with a fucking antenna
 You fucking with this man, you can be this man's dinner
 The 9 give me brains but the AK add liver
 The rapper is insane flowing like a mad river
 Make your ass quiver like you naked at winter
 Hollygrove honcho, hard time giver
 I'm a shark in the water, you just Long John Silver
 I got a girl, you wanna meet her?
Her name is 9 millimeter



 
 If I got 9 slugs, 9 bullets gone fly
 If I got a red beam, 9 people gone die
 9 mamas gone cry, 9 spirits in the sky
9 preachers preaching, 9 sermons telling 9 lies
Cause each and every one of y'all 9 niggas wasn't shit
I would have rather kept the 9 rugers in the ruger clip
 The index finger slipped, the 9 let 9 spit
 I lick em all like eighteen tits on 9 chicks
 I'm a suicide risk, 9 slits on each wrist
If I die 9 times the next go-arounds a bitch
 And if I come back, I'll throw 99 shows
And shove 9 inches of dick in 99 hoes




 I'm a west coast original, black John Wayne
Nigga where we from we like to pop that thang
You better stop that, mang
 Fat mouth to Dogg and I'ma pop-pop-bang
 Pigs wanna bust me, hoes wanna suck me
Niggas wanna touch me, none of that, trust me
I'm too slick, too sly, never snitch, I let it ride
 I set aside all my feelings when I'm killing like a villain
 Move quick like a cheetah, I'm a killa,I ain't here to lock up
I flash the heater, then lock your whole block up
Dip-dop-deeter Banner turn the beat up
Illa-fo-reala my nilla dilla never caught
You niggas always acting hard
 I keep a 9 millimeter in my waist and got 2 more in the car
Yeah you're all about to get it so quit it, tryin' to conceal it
You'll fuck around and make me reveal it, so killas kill it
