I'm tryna talk to you but the music too loud
Girl I know a quiet place where we can vibe out
 I ain't like your ex, you can let your guard down
 Tell your girls your with a real one, so they can calm down
 Oooh yeah, they can calm down
They saying I'm the nigga, that's the word around town
Oooh yeah that's the word around town
If you didn't know before then I bet you know now


 Baby you got everything that a nigga want
I just wanna put you on
 And I just wanna see you with them Vicky's on
Better yet, with them off


Oooh let's ride out
(You got everything that a nigga want)
Oooh let's ride out
(You got everything that a nigga want)
 Yeah, I got the car outside if you ready
(If you with it)
Only if you ready
Tell them valet niggas go and get it
(Go and get it)
Only if you ready
(Oh she ready)


Tell the valet go and get it
 From the ZooGang, I'm wanted in Venice
 Got a bad ass honey in Venice
 And this beat so hard, you gotta feel it
 I just fell in love with the west side
 Come get high, let me take you on a jet ride
 If you ready, I can show you what the set like
 So fine, swear I see you with my left eye


 Baby you got everything that a nigga want
I just wanna put you on
 And I just wanna see you with them Vicky's on
Better yet, with them off


Oooh let's ride out
(You got everything that a nigga want)
Oooh let's ride out
(You got everything that a nigga want)
 Yeah, I got the car outside if you ready
(If you with it)
Only if you ready
Tell them valet niggas go and get it
(Go and get it)
Only if you ready
(Oh she ready)

 
 I'm the type to send you to the spa
Same time try you in a car
I'm the type to pull up in valet
Pay a door to park a quarter million dollar car
Jumped in the whip and I growed
She went from the pole to the floor
It ain't no stressin', you know I'm a blessin'
She'll get a real nigga a warrant, I should
I do her, no brake fluid
Everything a G, oh the way I run through it
You like when I spoon, yeah make you sleep good
And then I pull it out and I make you talk to it
Talk to 'em


 Oooh let's ride out
(You got everything that a nigga want)
Oooh let's ride out
(You got everything that a nigga want)
Yeah, I got the car outside if you ready
(If you with it)
 Only if you ready
Tell them valet niggas go and get it
(Go and get it)
Only if you ready
(Oh she ready)


 All the way from New Jersey, here to LA
 You gon' hear this when your radio play
 on the way
Got me one tryna hit the valet
