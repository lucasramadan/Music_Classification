Great King Rat died today


Born on the twenty first of May
Died syphilis forty four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law


Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?


Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg or will I borrow?
I don't care I don't care anyway
Come on come on the time is right
I told you ah yes I told you
And that's no lie oh no no no




Now listen all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're going to be h
Don't listen to what mama says
Not a word not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
The great Lord before He died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're going to realize tomorrow
No I'm not going to tell you
What you already know
Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come come on the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before
