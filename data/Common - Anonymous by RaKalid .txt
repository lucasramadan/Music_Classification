 My intellectual is sectioned into many segments
As precious as my rhyme is I keep them all anonymous
To purify my essences eliminate the rivalry
Cause they hurting me. I give them all of everything
The love with no condition and they stealing trying
To rob me For that I give them props
Cause I give them all a lot
 They thinking that my kindness will manipulate my weakness
Then I give you all a warrantee I guarantee you flop
Benefit of Doubts is only good for so long I validate improvements
But suddenly you clueless all you do is prolong
I wonder why your blueprints structural analysis
Is never even close moderate No charges left in battery
I question if you want it when I gave it
You ain't take it just evacuated scenery
I don't trust them obviously cause all they do is bother me
So now I'm vibing with Bobby Marley
Cause his little is a lot of it
Ay Yo

Ay Yo.. Ima be Anonymous Cause I’m a True Artist
Show them where my heart is express a different part of me
Free Living Driven by the vision And with that type of Focus..
It’s hard for me to Listen notice the mental prison
Plenty don’t pay attention slip in the Message
Without a mention ignorant Intervention
Let me spread the infection start in a little section
Then slowly keeps spreading influence for my Brethren
I’m trying to make it that it’s better than it was
Something other than Gangsta Rap I see traps got to watch that step
Lost without trying you def (definitely) getting left
I’m One of the blessed Follow the quest without question
Open Mind. Knowledge turns into weapons
 So, when I write it’s low key under a different alias
So you don’t know it’s me
Ayy.. Yo
