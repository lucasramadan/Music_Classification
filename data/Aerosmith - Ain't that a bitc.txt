Up in smoke you've lost another lover
As you take a hit off your last cigarette
Strung out, burn out
Yeah you're down on your luck
 And you don't give a
Until the best part of you starts to twitch
Isn't that a bitch


Freak out! I'm alone now
I feel just like I'm losing my mind
Because love is like the right dress
On the wrong girl
You never know what you're going to find
You think you're high and fine as wine
Then you wind up like a dog in a ditch
Because love is like a wrong turn
On a cold night...yeah
Isn't that a bitch, isn't that a bitch


In a daze
In the throes of emotion
You see God in the Devil's eyes
Then you fall so far from grace
You wouldn't know a kiss
If it was on your face
You can tell it to the jury
But you aren't got no case




Then you feel so out of place
Licking up the arsenic
From the same old lace
You know the stuff is poison
But you got to have a taste
