Evil walks


Black shadow hanging over your shoulder
Black mark up against your name
Your green eyes couldn't get any colder
There's bad poison running through your veins


Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks arouse you
Evil walks behind you


Black widow weaving evil notions
Dark secrets being spun in your web
Good men going down in your ocean
They can't swim because they're tied to your bed




You just cry wolf
I sometimes wonder where you park your broom
Oh black widow
Come on weave your web
Down in your ocean
You got them tied to your bed
With your dark, dark secrets
And your green, green eyes
You black widow




Evil walks so bad
