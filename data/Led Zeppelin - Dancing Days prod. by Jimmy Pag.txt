Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
 I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows


I said it's alright
You know it's alright
 I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only
My one and only
Is that the way it should start?


 Crazy ways are evident
By the way you wearing your clothes
 Sipping booze is precedent
 As the evening starts to glow



Do you


You told your mother I'd get you home
But you didn't say that I got no car
I saw a lion, he was standing alone
 With a tadpole in a jar
