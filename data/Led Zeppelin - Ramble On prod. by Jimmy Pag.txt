Leaves are falling all around, It's time I was on my way
 Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
 But now it's time for me to go. The autumn moon lights my way
 For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
 Sometimes I grow so tired, but I know I've got one thing I got to do


 Ramble On, And now's the time, the time is now, to sing my song
 I'm going around the world, I got to find my girl, on my way
 I've been this way ten years to the day, Ramble On
 Gotta find the queen of all my dreams


 Got no time to for spreading roots, The time has come to be gone
 And to' our health we drank a thousand times, it's time to Ramble On




 Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
 How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
 T'was in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one
 Crept up and slipped away with her, her, her....yeah



 Going to ramble on, sing my song. Gotta keep-a-searching for my baby...
Going to work my way, round the world. I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Got to keep searching for my baby. I can't find my bluebird!
