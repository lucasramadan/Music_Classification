2Chainz]
Cell phone ringing tryna blank it
 In D.C getting money, DMV one hundred
 Hair hanging down to my stomach
 And I'm making play like DeShaun
And I'm ballin' out like John Wall
 I just brought me a pound of gas
 I'mma smoke joints till it's all gone
 Okay awwsome, in a Porsche eating lobster
 2 chains on with crosses, lipstick stain on balls
I ain't with the losses, the process is nonsense
Whip, sit in all set, might give her the sausage
Me and Skooly walk, talk down to the car
Hit her with the dick, leave her with a beauty mark
She say we all the same, I say "bitch come hit this reefer"
 She say that "I don't like them niggas", I say "I don't like 'em either"

 


 A$AP tatted on my belly like I'm Makaveli
 That peanut butter product probably why they acting jelly
You actin' petty, packin' daily cause my chain heavy
 Flaco be in D.C. like I'm Wayne Perry
 I beat that, speak that awwsome
 She wanna have a foursome
She know more friends so call some
Call them often for the moresome
 Exhaust 'em, boss 'em, toss 'em
Loss 'em like abortion
 Window shopping notion
Wasted times important
Problems with it cost 'em
 All you boys fugazy, I got hoes for days
 My rugged lookin' J's bout as stainless as my braids
But I'm paid, shout glizzy
DMV that's NYC, TX, LA we talk fly shit
Get off my dick if you don't like this
Cause I'm like
