I'm sittin' in a bar, tippin' a jar in Jackson
And on the street the summer sun it shines
 There's many a barroom queen
I've had in Jackson
 But I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

 
It's the honky tonk women
Give me, Give me, Give me the honky tonk blues


 I laid a divorcee in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady she all dressed me up in roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind
