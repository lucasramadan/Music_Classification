It's a critical solution
And the east coast got the blues
It's a mass of confusion
Like the lies they sell to you
You got a glass jawed toothache
Of a mental disease
And they be running round back
See them line up on their knees
Cause the kiss ass sycophants
Throwing penance at your feet
When they got nowhere to go
Watch them come in off the streets
While they're banging out front
Inside their slamming
To the crunch
Go on an throw me
To the lions
And the whole
Damn screaming bunch
Cause the pissed-off rip-offs
They're everywhere you turn
Tell me how a generation's
Ever supposed to learn


This fire is burning
And it's out of control
It's not a problem
You can stop
It's rock n' roll


I read it on a wall
It went straight to my head
It said Dance to the tension
Of a world on edge
We got racial violence
And who'll cast the first stone
And when sex is used
Anyway it can be
Sometimes when I look out
It's hard to see the day
It's a feeling you can have it
It's not mine to take away


Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said we're lost in the
Garden of Eden
And there's no one's
Gonna believe this
But we're lost in the
Garden of Eden


This fire is burning and
It's out of control
It's not a problem
You can stop
It's rock n' roll
Suck on that


Looking through
This point of view
There's no way
I'm gonna fit in
No you tell me
What my eyes see
Don't you tell me
Who to believe in
I ain't superstitious
But I know when
Something's wrong
I've been dragging my heels
With a bitch called hope
Let the undercurrent
Drag me along


Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said we're lost in the
Garden of Eden
And there's no one's
Gonna believe this
But we're lost in the
Garden of Eden, come on


Come on most
Organized religions
Make a mockery of humanity
Our governments are
Dangerous and out of control
The Garden of Eden is
Just another graveyard
Said if they had
Someone to buy it
Said I'm sure
They'd sell my soul




Lost in the Garden of Eden
Said we're lost in the
Garden of Eden
 (And we ain't talkin' about no
Poison apple or some
Missin' rib ya hear)
Said there's no one's
Gonna believe this
Said we're lost in the
Garden of Eden
This fire is burning and
It's out of control
It's not a problem you
Can stop, it's rock n' roll
