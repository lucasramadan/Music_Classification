I'm rolling thunder pouring rain
I'm coming on like a hurricane
White lightning flashing across the sky
 You're only young but you're going to die
I won't take no prisoners won't spare no lives
Nobody's putting up a fight
 I got my bell I'm going to take you to hell
I'm going to get you satan get you


 Hells bells, hells bells
Hells bells, you got me ringing
Hells bells, my temperature's high
Hells bells


I'll give you black sensations up and down your spine
 If you're into evil, you're a friend of mine
 See the white light flashing as I split the night
 Because if good's on the left then I'm sticking to the right
 I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
 Nobody's putting up a fight
I got my bell I'm going to take you to hell
I'm going to get you satan get you


 Hells bells, hells bells
Hells bells, you got me ringing
Hells bells, my temperature's high
Hells bells



Hells bells, satan coming to you
Hells bells, he's ringing them now


Those hells bells, my temperature's high
Hells bells, across the sky
Hells bells, they're taking you down
Hells bells, they're dragging you down
Hells bells, going to split the night
Hells bells, there's no way to fight
