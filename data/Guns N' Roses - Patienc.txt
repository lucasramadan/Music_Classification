Shed a tear cause I'm missing you
I'm still alright to smile
 Girl I think bout you every day now
 Was a time when I wasn't sure but you
Set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now


 Said woman take it slow and it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said sugar make it slow and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience


 I sit here on the stairs cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now I'll wait dear
Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time
But you know love there's one more thing to consider


Said woman take it slow and things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
 Said sugar take the time cause the lights are shining bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it
We won't fake it, I'll never break it, cause I can't take it

 
Little patience, yeah
Need a little patience, yeah
Just a little patience, yeah
Some more patience, yeah
Could use some patience yeah
Gotta have some
Patience yeah
All it takes is patience
Just a little patience
Is all you need

 
 I've been walking the streets at night
Just trying to get it right
It's hard to see with so many around
You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd
 And the streets don't change but maybe the names
 I ain't got time for the game cause I need you
Yeah yeah yeah
Cause I need you
Ooo I need you, whoa I need you
Ooh all this time
