What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
 Fire in the street, fire in my swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your little sister
 Just get a sip of this elixir, before they crop us out of the picture
 I've never seen a crop circle but I've seen a cop circled the block
 I puff squares, but I swear one day I'mma stop my nerves itch
On the brink of my career, while my peers struggle for employment
 Can you hear these screams (Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me)
 One two, three four grams and a fifth of Hennessey
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary


 Section 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan, we raising hell


 Lord forbid, the homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in
 The president is black, but you can't vote for skin, you vote for the better man
 Come to our show you can see the diversity
Unify people they going to peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we going to manipulate it, I hope you participating
 Ayo Dot, won't you let these cats know
We knew we'd be here, like back in 04'
 Started HiiiPower because our generation
Needed a generator and a system, meant to disintegrate us
 And all we do is assist them
We're not victors, we're victims
 The bigger picture hasn't developed yet
 Like what if Keisha were celibate
 What if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like children
 My nigga cheated on his girlfriend with his girlfriend's girlfriend
 Let the world end
 And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well (Odd Future's aight)
But our future is not, that Martial law shit dropped, we gonna all get got
 So keep that question mark on your face
 Eat that fast food, and use that flouride toothpaste
 Hide your feelings from the public
 Work a little nine to five, don't forget to pay your tithes
 And to thank God you're alive (HiiiPower)
 And on another note, we focused like the Hubble Telescope, Soul


 Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam


 I wrote this because I was ordered to
 People say I speak for generation Y
 Why lie, I do, Section 80
 Your son will play me if the radio won't
 Daughters that just turn one to twenty one listen to Kendrick
For instance


 What's your life about, enlighten me
 Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
 Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV


 True story, hmm, can you repeat that for me Soul


 What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
Is you gonna plead the fifth, or sound the horn
The time is now my child, come on


 See a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes
God and history all in the same sentence
You know what all the things have in common
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I've spent twenty three years on the earth searching for answers
'til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
 I'm not on the outside looking in, I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
 You've ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
 My innocence been dead
 So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes
God and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it cause you too are searching for answers
 I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially aware rapper
 I am a human mothafuckin' being, over dope ass instrumentation
 Kendrick Lamar, now fuck 'em up Terrace (Soul!)


 I watch this fire that we’re gathered around
And see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you
 Section.80
Section.80 babies
 A generation of bliss and disobedience
Know they can't control us
Know they can't control you
Know they can't control us
 But we can control each other
We build our own world
 If you don't leave with nothing else tonight, you will leave with knowing yourself
 You will leave knowing that you represent something thats bigger than all of us
Our family
Heart, honor and respect
 This is you, this is me
 And we are HiiiPower
