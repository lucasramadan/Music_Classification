Don't do it, don't you try it
Don't do that, don't, don't, don't


Don't do that
You got a good thing going now
Don't do it, don't do it
Don't!
Don't try suicide
 Nobody's worth it
Don't try suicide
Nobody cares
Don't try suicide
 You are just going to hate it
Don't try suicide
Nobody gives a damn


So you think it's the easy way out
Think you are going to slash your wrists
This time
Baby when you do it all you do is
Get on my tits
Don't do that
Try try try baby




You need help
Look at yourself you need help
You need life
So don't hang yourself
It's ok, ok, ok, ok
You just can't be a prick teaser all of the time
A little bit attention - you got it
Need some affection - you got it
Suicide suicide suicide bid


Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, baby
Don't do it, don't do it, don't - do it!


Don't put your neck on the line
Don't drown on me babe
Blow your brains out
Don't do that
