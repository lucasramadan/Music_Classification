Back when Cain was able
Way before the stable
Lighting struck right down from the sky
A mother ship with fate said let's give it a try
Conscience was related
Man he was created
Lady luck took him by surprise
A sweet and bitter fruit
It surely opened his eyes
Well she ate it
Lordy it was love at first bite
Well she ate it
Never knowin wrong from right
Even Eve in Eden
Voices tried deceiving
With lies that showed the lady the way
At first she stopped turned and tried to walk away
Man he was believer
Lady was deceiver
So the story goes but you see
That snake was he
She just climbed right up his tree


Evil came like raining
Who knows who's to blaming
Something tried to lay her to waste
And all she want and need was just a little taste
