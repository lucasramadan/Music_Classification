Why do you look at me
When you hate me
Why should I look at you when
You make me hate you too
I sense a smell of
 Retribution in the air
I don't even understand
Why the fuck you even care
And I don't need
Your jealousy yeah
Why drag me down
In your misery
 And when you stare
 You don't think I feel it
But I'm going to deal it
Back to you in spades
When I'm having fun ya
Know I can't conceal it
Because I know you'd never
Cut in my game, oh no
And when you're talking
About a vasectomy, yeah
I'll be writing down
Your obituary history
You got your bitches
With the silicone injections
Crystal meth and
Yeast infections
Bleached blond hair
Collagen lip projections
Who are you to
Criticize my intentions
Got your subtle
Manipulative devices
Just like you I got my vices
I got a thought
That would be nice
I'd like to crush your
Head tight in my vice
Pain
And that goes for all of
You punks in the press
That want to start
Shit by printing lies
Instead of the things we said
 That means you
Andy Secher at Hit Parader
Circus magazine
Mick Wall at Kerrang!
 Bob Guccione Jr. at Spin
What you pissed off
Cause your dad gets
More pussy than you
Fuck you
Suck my fucking dick
You be ripping off
The fucking kids
While they be paying their hard
Earned money to read about
The bands they
Want to know about
Printing lies, starting controversy
You want to antagonize me
Antagonize me motherfucker
Get in the ring motherfucker
And I'll kick your bitchy little ass
Punk
I don't like you
I just hate you
I'm going to kick your ass
Oh yeah! oh yeah
You may not like
Our integrity yeah
We built a world out
Of anarchy oh yeah!
 And in this corner, weighing
In at 850 pounds
Guns n' roses!
 Get in the ring[x15]
Yeah


This song is dedicated
To all the
Guns n' fucking roses fans
Who stuck with us through
All the fucking shit
And to all those opposed
Hmm well
