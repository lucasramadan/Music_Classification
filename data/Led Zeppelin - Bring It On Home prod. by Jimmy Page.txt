I've got my ticket, I've got that load. Got up, gone higher, all aboard
Take my seat, right way back. ooh yeah. Watch this train roll down the track

Watch out, watch out


Try to tell you baby, what you trying to do?
Trying to love me baby, love some other man too

Went a little walk downtown, messed and got back late
Found a note there waiting, it said, "Daddy, I just can't wait."
Bring it on home... Bring it back home to me baby

Bring it on home


Bring it on home, Bring it on home to you
