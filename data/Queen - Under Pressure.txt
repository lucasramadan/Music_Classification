Under pressure
That brings a building down
Splits a family in two

 
Puts people on streets

 
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da -that's okay


 It's the terror of knowing
What the world is about
 Watching some good friends
Screaming


'Let me out'
 Pray tomorrow gets me higher


 Pressure on people people on streets


 Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay
 Chipping around - kick my brains around the floor
 These are the days it never rains but it pours
 Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap

 People on streets
 ee da de da de
 People on streets
 ee da de da de da de da


It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming
[Together] 'Let me out'


Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Higher
High


 Pressure on people people on streets

 
Turned away from it all like a blind man
 Sat on a fence but it don't work

 
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn

Why - why - why?

Love love love love love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[6:Mercury]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love give love give love give love
Give love give love give love give love give love

 
Because love's such an old fashioned word
 And love dares you to care for
The people on the (People on streets) edge of the night
And loves (People on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
 This is our last dance
This is our last dance
 This is ourselves
Under pressure
 Under pressure
Pressure
