When you're talkin' to yourself
And nobody's home
You can fool yourself
You came in
This world alone
Alone


 So nobody ever told you baby
How it was gonna be
So what'll happen
To you baby
Guess we'll have
To wait and see
One,two


 Old at heart but
I'm only 28
 And I'm much too young
To let love break my heart
Young at heart but it's getting
Much too late
To find ourselves
So far apart
 I don't know how you're
S'posed to find me lately
An what more could
You ask from me
How could you say that
I never needed you
When you took everything
Said you took
Everything from me
Young at heart an it
Gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can
Seem to help me now
Old at heart but
I musn't hesitate
If I'm to find my
Own way out
Still talking to myself
And nobody's home
Alone




 When I find out all the reasons
Maybe I'll find another way
Find another day
 With all the changing
Seasons of my life
Maybe I'll get it right next time
An now that you've
Been broken down
Got your head out
Of the clouds
You're back down
On the ground
 And you don't talk so loud
An you don't walk so proud
Any more, and what for
 Well I jumped into the river
Too many times to make it home
I'm out here on my own
An drifting all alone
If it doesn't show give it time
To read between the lines
Cause I see the
Storm getting closer
And the waves
They get so high
Seems everything
We've ever known's here
 Why must it drift away and die
I'll never find anyone
To replace you
Guess I'll have to make it through
This time oh this time
Without you
I knew the storm
Was getting closer
 And all my friends said
I was high
But everything
We've ever known's here
I never wanted it to die
