For sinners, saintsand scramblersand gamblers
And dirty money handlers, dignitariesand champions, narcotic traffickers
Talented number runners and racketeers
 Stars of stage, page and cameras,slang swingers and swaggerers
 Double barrels and Derringers, automatics and miracles
 Europe Asia and Africa, all the time in America
 Atlantic, Ashland, Alblemarle to Albany
Bridge into Baltic, Bedford Ave, Bergen Street
Clinton to Cadman, Church Ave to Clarendon
Road to Central Avenue, Cooper House, Cypress
 And live from Bedford-Stuyvesant
The livest high flyingest pilot bombardier from Pyrrhus
Stationed live and direct, Medinamastermind set
 Ya can't lock my set now lock off, cool
 Peace to the nation of the Gods and the Earths
 And the Sun, Moon &amp; Stars, furthermore born knowledge go hard

 
Remix, rising up out of the flames like a phoenix
 Strainin' to carry the weight of my brain like a genius
 Knowin' I'm sowin' them seeds
Let's see whose thumb is the greenest
 If I said it I mean it
 And did it because I need it
 Eat sleep it and bleed it
Write it down and then read it
Asphalt to the cement
 Your trash talk is deleted
Blastoff, I lay them out like a Tempurpedic
 Black Thought, I told you I'ma win eventually
 This unsung, underrated, under appreciated
The one them underachievers had underestimated
 Finally graduated from something that's so hated
To one of the most sacred, nobody gonna take it
 Face it, I keep doing it well
 Doin' it sans assistance
Is do it yourself, doin' it below the radar
We doin' it stealth, doing it again
 For Illadelphand who else? But check it out
Y'all see him on a job, see my eyes focused where the prize be
 I'm like Martin Luther King you like Rodney
 The difference is I give it everything inside me
 Dear Diary, my fans still swear by me
Even though I'm late night now like here's Johnny
 Swimming with them great whites nowis where you'll find me
 Funny how it break right down but never mind me
 I'm forever grimy, guess it's just Philly shining
Rock rolla bi-polar like Phyllis Hyman


 Like a dope fiend opening up a bottle of dopamine
 You're just hoping you don't get roped for your throat get choked anything
 Oh and just think how dope he could be if he smoked anything
 Oh, there goes the bell, the sound of the opening ding
 I hit you as hard as barbituratesin the ribs with a switch
 And stitch you at the same time before you can flinch to it
 My dick is so big, if I add another inch to it
You would swear when I raped you that you was actually into it
 I'm not a baller but you can bet your fuckin' bottom dollar
 That I remember when I was without a dollar bill in my wallet
 Now watch me kill a koala while I maul a chihuahua
 Bum a pill off of Paula like let me holler at you, mama
 It's like I'm off the bombom when I bring the fuckin' drama
 Used to bomb ya like Saddam but now that I'm a little calmer
I'm a fuckin' cross between Osama, Dahmer, Obama, and Dalai Lama
 So Miley I'm a knight in shining armor
Mail a gift to Taylor Swift's trailer a picture
Of my genitalia with a note saying "bitch, I can't wait to nail ya"
 Drug paraphernalia beware the werewolf will kill ya
That's him in the sheep's clothes; he just shaved his hair off Cecilia
