You gave up the love you got &amp; that is fact
She loves me now she loves you not and that where its at
Cause when you thought your love was deep
Finders keepers losers weep yeah
Love my love my love du jour she is mine all mine
My minds made up ya i'm so sure because theres none so fine
The thing you found your losing sleep its all about the love you keep


Yeahs she is beyond beautiful
Yeah she never been nobodys fool that she'd be stuck with
Yeah it is all about me &amp; you
Believe or not theres nothing we got
Thats beyond beautiful


Full of lust
Full of love
Without no clue
And though i was the one sure of
And then came you
Into my life it served me right
Nobody ever did it quite like you




Yeah she's beyond beautiful
Yeah she never been nobodys fool that you'd be stuck with
Yeah its all about me &amp; you
Believe or not yeah what we got
It is beyond beautiful
