Found a head and an arm in the garbage can
Don't know why I'm here
Living on the run for oh so long
I got to go collect


Double talking jive
Get the money motherfucker
Because I got no more patience
Double talking
I got (lies)
No more patience man


Back in town and all new friends
They saying how you been?
 Fucked up and outta place
That's how I felt back then


Double talking jive
Get the money motherfucker
Because I got no more patience
Double talking
I got (lies)
No more patience man
You dig what I'm saying?!
