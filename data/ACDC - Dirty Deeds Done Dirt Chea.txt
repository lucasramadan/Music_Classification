If you're having trouble with the high school head
He's giving you the blues
 You wanna graduate but not in his bed
 Here's what you gotta do
Pick up the phone, I'm always home
Call me anytime
 36, 24, 36, oh
 I lead a life of crime


 Dirty deeds
Done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds
Done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds
Done dirt cheep
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap


 If you're having trouble with your life of love
You got a broken heart
He's double dealing with your best friend
That's when the tear drops start, fella
 Pick up the phone I'm here alone
Just make a social call
Come right in, forget about him
We'll have ourselves a ball



 If you got a lady and you want her gone
But you ain't got the guts
She keeps nagging at you night and day
Enough to drive you nuts
Pick up the phone, leave her alone
It's time you make a stand
For a fee, I'm happy to be
Your back door man



Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap


 Concrete shoes
 Cyanide, TNT!
Done dirt cheap!
 Contracts, neck ties
 High voltage!
Done dirt cheap!
Dirty deeds
I got a lotta dirty deeds
Done dirt cheap!
Dirty deeds
I got a lotta dirty deeds
Done dirt cheap!
Yeah!
