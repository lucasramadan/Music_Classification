A big beat with a bass
Arrangement each piece in its place

 Good God, a yes y'all
 I work it out, make it run, lift it off
Fly. I'm like a dove from up above
And when I rock they say, "That's my one!"
"That's my one!" Yeah "That's my one!"
"That's my one!", "That's my one!"
"That's my one!", I turn it up bump it up
And when it feel good to you it's good for real
And when it's real baby that's how it's how it's supposed to feel
Testify



 Matthews 6:33
Read and believe
It's in the book
