DJ Drama what it do my G?
 It's the world nigga
We running the summer
I swear the night is starting to feel just like the night before
You know I'm on avion all acting a fool-io
We putting sparkles on them bottles make them move the ho


 Step up in this bitch, you know I got my weapon
 This ain't a gym class, why is everybody sweating
 Yeah I send them hoes some bottles
Them bitches looking thirsty
My checks are for the rim
I'm in this bitch I'm looking birdy
You know the coupe is bloody murder
The coupe is bloody murder
Yeah that motherfucker black
 Let's all pour color purple
 34 squares so that 1200 a circle
 Do them numbers in his head
Swear that nigga smart as Urkel
 Mirror, mirror, should I kill them
 Gourmet to the Tims
 400 for this four door, and it ain't got no rims
 Tell my waitress keep them bottles coming
I'm drinking like a fish
When those sparklers pass your table
All you bitches make a wish


How much liquor it gonna take to get it cracking in this bitch
Look I came to get it in now why you acting this bitch
 Turn down for what? Turn down for what?
Just let me know give me the word I get it cracking in this ho
And I'm about to show out
You know it's packed up in this ho
Turn down for what? Turn down for what?


Motion picture shit, nigga I pull up in slo-mo
450 thou, I blew that on a two door
Shit I git a new , I'll send you to Pluto
Got a street nigga, but you knew that from the get-go
I'm turnt up to the max, and I'm just stunting on these niggas
I'm real as they say, so I'm holding court on these niggas
Wife beaters and jeans, and a pair of Jordans on these niggas
Head cocked to the back, and I smash the sport on these niggas
You get money then show it, if you ain't then stop lying
 If you looking for a nigga, bitch I ain't hard to find
Only nigga in the city, million dollars a car
How you kick it with the goon, you meant to be with the star




 Turn down for what
Made a few mill off two flows
 Big dog, Cujo
Your man here, you mad now
 In the booty club, I'm the cash cow
We turning up, we broke the knob up
 I'm on Xanex, trying not to nod off
 Finna bust your bitch like a sawed off
 Making NBA money, I'm a ball hog
Big blunts and nigga still facing
 Bank account look like The Matrix
Niggas be acting still hating
I'm rich and I stay super faded
 Pouring up that Bombay, let that reefer burn
Getting gobbled by your bitch, my nigga wait your turn
Groupie bitches on my balls
Got them dancing with the stars
Once a million dollar nigga
Half a million dollar cars
 Have to love them ratchet bitches
 They get 2 Live with the Crew
Make them pop that pussy open
Man I feel like Uncle Luke
