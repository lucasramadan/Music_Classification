I've been thinking about
Thinking bout sex
Always hungry for something
That I haven't had yet
Well maybe baby, you
Got something to lose
Well I got something
I got something for you


My way your way
Anything goes tonight
My way your way
Anything goes to


Panties round your knees
With your ass in debris
Doing that grind
With a push and a squeeze
Tied up, tied down
Up against the wall
Be my rubbermade baby
And we can do it all
