When I pull up people so fresh in my ride
 We smoke the best you can buy
 Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
 Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us


Uh, This one's for the g's, all black chucks on the cuffs on my jeans
 King size papers stuffed full of trees, I be with the boss dawg yall fuck niggas fleas
Now they say I'm hot hundred something degrees,taking pictures with a young nigga cheese
 Remember days homey, I ain't had a thing
Now I'm hopping off the plane putting roaches on the wing
 And my hoes like queens, but we smoke like kings
 Jewelery froze like bling, money come fast you're slow like lean
Rolling up grass, sold weed to half the staff, so I know iâ€™m gonna pass
 Third period, Showing up last with a late note blowing grey smoke


 When I pull up people so fresh in my ride
 We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us


We blow to the middle of the day
 Wiz say dawg put a little in the jay
 Hey, why not? Not why?
We fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high
 Fuck it, everybody to the library
 Got a new batch, some blue, boo-berry
 Stuck in the hallway, we pass he say dog he just smoke all day
It's a mind game, like the lean I seen to keep migranes
 Ritchie Valens,and bitch I'm freaking limeade
 I'm so lifted, like a parachute
 My grass, they off they all Ferris Beuller
 Slip away, dip away,almost had to throw a zip away
But fuck that, this the taylor gang, what you want dog Shit I'm on everythang



[Outro - Snoop Dogg/Lion] x2
I said you niggas never have and you never will
You niggas never have and you never will
You niggas never have and you never will
 Big snoop &amp; young wiz here to kill

Haha, yeah you niggas still in junior high school, elementary ass niggas
Holla at me when you graduate
We be posted up by four hundred billion
 Room 420
 Follow your nose, you nose knows... haha
