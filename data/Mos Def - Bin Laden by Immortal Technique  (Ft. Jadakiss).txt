Man you hear this bullshit they be talking
 Every day, man
 It's like these motherfuckers is just like professional liars
You know what I'm sayin
It's wild
Listen


 Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
 It was you, nigga
 Tell the truth, nigga
 Bush knocked down the towers
 Tell the truth, nigga
 Bush knocked down the towers
 Tell the truth, nigga


 I pledge no allegiance
 Nigga, fuck the President's speeches
 I'm baptized by America and covered in leeches
The dirty water that bleaches your soul and your facial features
 Drowning you in propaganda that they spit through the speakers
 And if you speak about the evil that the government does
 The Patriot Act will track you to the type of your blood
 They try to frame you
And say you was trying sell drugs
 And throw a federal indictment on niggas to show you love
 This shit is run by fake Christians
 Fake politicians
 Look at they mansions
Then look at the conditions you live in
 All they talk about is terrorism on television
 They tell you to listen
But they don't really tell you they mission
 They funded Al-Qaeda and now they blame the Muslim religion
 Even though Bin Laden was a CIA tactician
 They gave him billions of dollars and they funded his purpose
 Fahrenheit 9/11
 That's just scratching the surface




 They say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam
But that's bullshit
I'll show you why it's totally wrong
Cuz if another country invaded the hood tonight
It'd be warfare through Harlem
And Washington Heights
I wouldn't be fighting for Bush or White America's dream
I'd be fighting for my people's survival and self-esteem
I wouldn't fight for racist churches from the South, my nigga
I'd be fighting to keep the occupation out, my nigga
 You ever clock someone who talk shit, or look at you wrong
Imagine if they shot at you
And was raping your moms
 And of course Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons
We sold him that shit
After Ronald Reagan's election
 Mercenary contractors fighting a new era
 Corporate military banking off the war on terror
 They controlling the ghetto with the fear of attack
 Tryna distract the fact that they engineering the crack
 So I'm strapped like Lee Malvo holding a sniper rifle
 These bullets will touch your kids and I don't mean like Michael
 Your body be sent to the morgue
Stripped down and recycled
 I fire on house niggasthat support you and like you
 Cuz innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily
And poor people never get shit and struggle daily
 This ain't no alien conspiracy theory
This shit is real
 Written on the dollar underneath the Masonic seal

 
 I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President dead
 It's never been said but I set precedents)



 
 Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
