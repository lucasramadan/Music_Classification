Did you ever feel the pain
That he felt upon the cross
Did you ever feel the knife
Tearing flesh that's oh so soft


Did you ever touch the night
Did you ever count the cost
Do you hide away the fear
Put down paradise as lost


Yeah you're blinded by rainbows
Watching the wind blow
Blinded by rainbows
Do you dream at night
Do you sleep at night
I doubt it


Did you ever feel the blast
As the Semtex bomb goes off
Do you ever hear the screams
As the limbs are all torn off
Did you ever kiss the child
Who just saw his father shot
Do you ever shed a tear
As the war drags on and on






Do you ever fear the night
Could it be the war is lost
Do you fear the final hour
Do you kneel before the cross
