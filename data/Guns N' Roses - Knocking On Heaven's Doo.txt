Mama take this
Badge from me
I can't use it anymore
 It's getting dark
Too dark to see
 Feels like I'm
Knockin' on heaven's door


Knock knock
Knocking on heaven's door
Knock knock
Knocking on heaven's door
Knock knock
Knocking on heaven's door
Knock knock
Knocking on heaven's door


 Mama put my guns
In the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
 That cold black cloud
Is comin' down
Feels like I'm knockin'
On heaven's door




 You just better start
Sniffing your own
Rank subjugation jack
 Because it's just you
Against your tattered libido
The bank and
The mortician, forever
 Man and it wouldn't
Be luck if you could
Get out of life alive
