Down by the seaside
See the boats go sailing
Can the people hear
What the little fish are saying


 Oh, oh, the people turned away
Oh, the people turned away


 Down in the city streets, see all the folk go racing, racing
No time left, to pass the time of day


 The people turned away
The people turned away
So far away, so far away


See how they run, see how they run, see how they run, see how they run
 Do you still do the twist
Do you find you remember things that well
I wanna tell you
Some go twisting every day
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell


Out in the country, hear the people singing
Singing about their progress, knowing where they're going




Oh, oh, the people turned away
Oh, the people turned away


 Sing loud for the sunshine, pray hard for the rain
And show your love for Lady Nature. And she will come back again
The people turned away
