Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train and that you're headin'
Out to Hollywood
Girl you been givin' me that line so many times it kinda gets like
Feelin' bad looks good

[Bridge: Aerosmith]
 That kinda loving
Turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving
Sends a man right to his grave


I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
 You turn it on
 Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue


 You're packing up your stuff and talking like it's tough and trying
To tell me that it's time to go
 But I know you ain't wearing nothing underneaththat overcoat
 And it's all a show


 That kind of loving
Makes me want to pull
Down the shade, yeah
That kind of loving
Yeah now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same


I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue


I'm losing my mind, girl
Cause I'm going crazy
I need your love, honey
I need your love


Crazy, crazy, crazy, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
I'm losing my mind, girl
Cause I'm going crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy for you baby
 You turn it on, then your gone
 Yeah you drive me
