Now greetings to the world
 And to the intelligence of mankind
Is what makes us special among all other species
 Everything is beautiful if found congregation before it


 These ancient thoughts
This ancient love
These ancient hearts
These ancient souls
These ancient songs
These ancient people

These ancient thoughts
This ancient love
These ancient hearts
These ancient souls
These ancient hopes
These ancient people


 Like the earth, and the sky
And the sea, and the birds
And the trees, and the sun
Melody
Like a mountain, like a valley
Like the river, like the lake
Like the earth, when it quakes
Space and sea


 This is rock and roll meets aristotle
 I fly those G5's through the skies to Cabbo
 Martial arts more ancient than Tae Bo
 Swordsman, more ancient than Zorro
 Ancient like the pharohs or priests of Yoruba
 Or Obeah euphobia you peril
 Your paths narrow like climbing mount Kilimanjaro
 Ancient men traded cattle
Before columbus was lost in travel, ancient canoes got paddeled
Before the horse saddle there was camel
 Spears before arrow, arrow before ammo
 Tribal paint before camo-flage
 Chief before sarge, or lieutenant
Village elders before the senate
 Used to sail the seas before the compass was invented
 Ancient people spoke free, they didn't need a 1st amendment
 In the beginning, the drum was the text sending
There was moons before months, and time before minutes




 From love, onto language, onto hieroglyphics
The Invention of the wheel, onto mathematics
The almanac, the calender, onto geographics
Herbal medicine, to anti-biotic Ginseng to acetonic
Water pump, water pump, to onto hydrolics
Moonlight, candle light, onto electronics
Instinct to knowledge, classroom to college
 Oh, all of These ancient thoughts




Man a Bust the earth, man a Bust the sky
Junior Gong, and Junior Reid we meditation it so high
Man a trod the gravel, it dirty and it dry
Oh, dem no see no wings, but man a fly
Babylon fi splurt, dem no know what life is worth
Oh, tell dem stop polluting mother earth
Man a make a trot, me robe, me sandles and me rod
Dem shouldve known, hear say man this man a God
