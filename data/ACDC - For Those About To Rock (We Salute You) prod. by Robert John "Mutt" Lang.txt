We roll tonight
To the guitar bite
 Stand up and be counted
For what you are about to receive
 We are the dealers
We'll give you everything you need
Hail hail to the good times
Because rock has got the right of way
We are not no legend, isn’t no cause
We're just living for today


 For those about to rock, we salute you
For those about to rock, we salute you


We rock at dawn on the front line
 Like a bolt right out of the blue
The sky's alight with the guitar bite
 Heads will roll and rock tonight




We're just a battery for hire with a guitar fire
Ready and aimed at you
 Pick up your balls and load up your cannon
 For a twenty-one gun salute


For those about to rock - fire
 We salute you
Shoot, shoot
We salute you
(Isn’t going to get tired, won't take a break, we salute you)
