Living easy
Loving free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Asking nothing
Leave me be
Taking everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing that I’d rather do
Goin' down
Party time
My friends are gonna be there too


 I’m on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
 I’m on the highway to hell


 No stop signs
Speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
 Like a wheel
Gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
 Hey satan
Paying my dues
Playing in a rocking band
 Hey mama
Look at me
 I’m on the way to the promised land
 I’m on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I’m on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Don't stop me


 I’m on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I’m on the highway to hell
(Highway to hell) I’m on the highway to hell
(Highway to hell) highway to hell
(Highway to hell) highway to hell
(Highway to hell)
And I’m going down
All the way
I’m on the highway to hell
