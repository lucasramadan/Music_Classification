Ain't no way around it [x6]


 A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer - that's something you need to know
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
 A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, we just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it


 I had a young, hot thang fucked my bro and gave 'em brain
And she expect for me to love her, I can never be a lame
 I'm attracted to her sexually, but she ain't my main dame
 We can be the best of friends, shawty, but you off the chain
 See I ain't gonna hold it against ya, I'mma keep it pimping with ya
Don't you come at me with issues, ain't tryna get all in your mixture
 I ain't tryna come to get ya, you can meet me somewhere on Peach street
 At the W on the Fourteenth, ain't tryna fuck no ho tryna know me
 And they wanna fuck my woodie, already smashed the homie
 Half of these bitches phony, singing love songs like Toni
Ms. Braxton you the action, stop acting
Just another sad love song waiting to happen

 


A killer gonna' be a killer, that's regardless of the fact that I'm Tin Man heartless
No love for ya' baby unless you walkin' through my living room braless
With your nipples pokin' through ya wife beater, you the mic eater
 She doing Daddy Fat Stacks soon as I meet her
Get it meet her, cut to the chase like a cheetah cause she want that Peta
Pipe her down, gon' wipe her clown when so many niggas un-wiped her down
You hopin' that she gon' turn her life around, about face, a full one-eighty
A ho into a housewife, that's your lady and me, I never give another but a dope baby
With a good time and a dope dick, she love the way I talk and my flow slick
Ain't no way around it
Yo-yo-yo-yo-your bitch in love with my dick
But big don't love her at all, let a monkey nigga pay the bills while I scrub them jaws
Like a test for DNA, TNA, we the A




 Ball so had I need ace of spades, livin' life through these ray bans
Drop four, whipped up eight man
How you do that, got great hands
I ain't seen you niggas like Ray Charles, figure I'll drive these eight car
 Trynna' figure how I'ma fuck these eight hoes, same time increase my bank roll
 Broke shit had my vision blurred, so I went and copped me a quarter bird
Got me a job got work to do, need a job nig got work for you
Hood lil' niggas die by respect, niggas bleeding what they readin' on the internet
Where ya' from? nigga where ya' plug?
Just like I thought, niggas silent thugs
That is a job fuck niggas hate, why you think I'm carrying this seven-eight
Twenty-two rounds that'll keep me straight, if I ain't got that then I make and bake
Been gettin' money since baby Nate, red monkey, I'mma watch junkie
Ain't no way really 'round that, made them young niggas screaming, "where the pounds at?"
What
