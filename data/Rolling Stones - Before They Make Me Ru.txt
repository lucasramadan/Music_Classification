Worked the bars and sideshows along the twilight zone
Only a crowd can make you feel so alone
And it really hit home
 Booze and pills and powders, you can choose your medicine
Well here's another goodbye to another good friend
After all is said and done
Got to move while it's still fun
 Let me walk before they make me run
After all is said and done
I got to move, it's still fun
I'm going to walk before they make me run
Watched the taillights fading, there are not a dry eye in the house
They're laughing and singing
 Started dancing and drinking as I left town
Going to find my way to heaven, because I did my time in hell
 I wasn't looking too good but I was feeling real well

After all is said and done
I got to move I had my fun
Let us walk before they make me run

 After all is said and done
I did alright, I had my fun
I will walk before they make me run
