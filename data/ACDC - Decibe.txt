Take up all your time
Kick up your heels, looking fine
And you come riding blind
You come rolling back a while
Wind blowing on you
We are going to move on and on
Sweating heat soak you all
Being out will make you crawl all night


 Decibel[x2]


Has you from deep inside
You were waving then you smiled
Give me rock and roll
They are in love
Love, in the rain
They are in there rocking standing proud


Decibel
That's the history of rock n roll
Decibel


Rain is coming on
We are going to ride along
A hundred miles in all
Getting in night until dawn
Spread the joy going on
Yeah, hard and long
Staring down
 With a shock hit the ground


Decibel[x3]
You come rolling back a while
Decibel
