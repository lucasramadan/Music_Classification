Oh isn't she sweet
Well see her walking down that street
Yes I ask you very confidentially
Isn't she sweet?


Oh isn't she nice
Well look her over once or twice
Yes I ask you very confidentially
Isn't she nice?


Just cast an eye
In her direction
Oh me oh my
Isn't that perfection?


Oh I repeat
Well don't you think that's kind of neat?
Yes I ask you very confidentially
Isn't she sweet?










Oh isn't she sweet
Well see her walking down that street
Well I ask you very confidentially
Isn't she sweet?
Well I ask you very confidentially
Isn't she sweet?
