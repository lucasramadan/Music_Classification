It don't really matter
Going to find out for yourself
No it don't really matter (ooh)
Going to leave this thing to
Somebody else


If they were missionaries
Real time visionaries
Sitting in a Chinese stew
To view my dis-infatuation

I know that I'm a classic case
Watch my dis-enchanted face
 Blame it on the Falun Gong
They've seen the end and you can't hold on now

Because it would take a lot more hate than you
To end the fascination
Even with an iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
 When all I've got is precious time


It don't really matter
Guess I'll keep it to myself
Said it don't really matter
It's time I look around for
Somebody else


Because it would take a lot more time than you
Have got for masturbation
Even with your iron fist
More than you got to rule the nation
But all we got is precious time
More than you got to fool the nation
But all I got is precious time





It don't really matter
I guess you'll find out for yourself
No it don't really matter
So you can hear it now from
Somebody else


You think you got it all locked up inside (It don't really matter)
And if you beat 'em enough they'll die (It don't really matter)
It's like a walk in the park from the cell (It don't really matter)
Now you're keeping your own kind in hell (It don't really matter)
 When your Great Wall rocks, blame yourself(It don't really matter)
 When their arms reach out for your help
And you're out of time
