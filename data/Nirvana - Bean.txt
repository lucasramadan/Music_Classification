I don't like you and I'm gonna beat you up

Beans, beans, beans
Japhy had some beans
He was happy, happy, happy
And he ate some beans

 Naked, naked, naked
Sitting cross-legged
Naked, naked, naked
And he was happy, happy, happy
And he ate some beans

 Wine, wine, wine
Japhy had some wine
He was happy, happy, happy
And he ate some wine

Beans, beans, beans
Daddy ate some beans
And he drank some wine
And he was happy, happy, happy
As he drank some beans
