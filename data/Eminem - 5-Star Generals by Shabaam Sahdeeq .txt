Of course I rap till I'm hoarse
 Add the sauce to them jive turkey MCs
Say what you like, I toss
 Your theory when you hear me like the guts of a dutch
 Snap caught you in the act like Vivitar AF
2-5-5 Autofocus clear vision
 Precision mics for people of all types
Call the calvary
Mic brutality, switch the pitch gradually
Aqua, turn-table knocka
 Fresh like Binaca
Jot the thoughts in my chronicles
Remarkable styles
Made an exit to spark mine
Nuclear physics, mechanicals and phat rhymes
 They know the time like a sundial
I'm X-File


 Went to Bible class with a gun, blasted a nun
 Fuck Hell, Satan sent my ass to the sun
 I wasn't born, I was hatched
 And dumped in the trash with a note attached
Sayin' someone please whip this brat's ass
 I never gave a rat's ass or a flyin' fuck
 Drivin' drunk in a fire truck with the siren stuck
Slammin' the brakes, skiddin' out cause the tires suck
 Went to pull you off my dick and got the pliers stuck
 You better run cause I'm probably the only one
Crazy enough to shoot your ass with a knife and stab you with a gun
 I like fire, you might see me start it
 I'm slightly retarded, I miss my sanity since the night we departed


 Yo Old World Disorder on some outnumber shit
We'd rather go out of control then to be under it
Yo how you gonna win against us when we got nothin to lose
Must be confused
Or prayin to a God that don't exist
It wouldn't save your Bible-kissin asses even if he did
We like to twist ya mystic, genetic dead-end
Don't got friends
Skam and Shadowman, posting children for depression
Stress in any language
 Say my name in Spanish
That's "Chupacabra", suck the life out of you
There won't be enough of your brain left to fill a teaspoon
We two vanishing men that makes the bad things blend
And probably go platinum on the day that the world ends

 "Rhymes that you never even heard before..."


When it comes to beef
I gets relief when I kill and breathe
 Send a wreathe get your family ready for the grief
I'll knock ya teeth
Take ya seat like a thief
Make you change your beliefs
Burn a leaf before you go beneath
Rappers, I kill 'em
Down to Hell is where I send 'em
Feelin' my pen is illin so much
 I need some penicillin
Jams I'm spillin cause I'm bound here
Kicking shit that's solitaire
Your crown is RIP cause rapper you sound counterfeit
You get a round of clips
If you play hard
You stay scarred
Thinkin you're brave ya'll
You're in a graveyard
One in a mil' son
I'm ill when it comes to skills
 Wanna get killed or catch a dum-dum in your grill
Rappers diminishin, in scrimmage
I'm good to the finish
I'll speak in English while your brothers are speakin in gibberish
You touch the mic and I'm out to bury your fingers
You want some fame? I'll beat you up in front of Jerry Springer
So pay the price, say they nice
When they play the dice
I'll take you life, slay you twice
Before you break your rights


Cats who rap are feminine
I'm sendin this without the benefits of cinema scents of cinnamon
So submit it in your mental
Since you find it essential to stencil simple sentences
A sentence is simple
You banned from usin writin utensils
Whether crayon, pen or pencil
Observe verse packed with syntax
That causes skin cracks on impact
 Send them wack men back to the lab
Where most of them laugh
I can hand you a manual to make what I plan to do more tangible
You still wouldn't understand the full concept
It slips through your fingers like sand granules
Scan the land and the blue sea annually
And you will see
 Which animals eat amphibians from spittin up that written stuff
It’s all the same
It’s the reason for cyphers prematurely spittin' up
Ironic phonics show my flow is far from ambionic
To be honest no hits of chronic in mi bionic
I'm beyond it
The texture of my lecture is complex like a professor
Skeptics greet me exceptional when I bless sound receptacles
Much stretchin through my vestibules
Turns crews to vegetables
They grab my testicles and cup em
Fuck em, bless em through, what
