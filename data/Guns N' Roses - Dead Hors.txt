Sick of this life
Not that you'd care
 I'm not the only one with
Whom these
Feelings I share
 Nobody understands
Quite why we're here
We're searching for answers
That never appear
 But maybe if I looked
Real hard I'd
I'd see your trying too
 To understand this life
That we're all going through
 Then when she said
She was going to like
Wreck my car
I didn't know what to do


 Sometimes I feel like
I'm beating a dead horse
And I don't know why
You'd be bringing me down
 I'd like to think that our love's
Worth a tad more
It may sound funny but you'd
Think by now, I'd be smiling
 I guess some things
Never change, never change


 I met an old cowboy
I saw the look in his eyes
Something tells me
He's been here before
 Cause experience
Makes you wise
I was only a small child
When the thought
First came to me
That I'm a son of a gun
And the gun of a son
That brought back
The devil in me




I am not quite what
You'd call an old soul
Still wet behind the ears
I been around this track
A couple of times
But now the dust is
Starting to clear
Oh, yeah


Sometimes I feel like
I'm beating a dead horse
I don't know why you'd
Be bringing me down
I'd like to think that our love's
Worth a tad more
It may sound funny but you'd
Think by now, I'd be smiling
Ooh, yeah, I'd be smiling
No way I'd be smiling
Oh smiling

 
Sick of this life
Not that you'd care
I'm not the only one
With whom these
Feelings I share
