If we could see tomorrow
What of your plans
 No one can live in sorrow
Ask all your friends
 Times that you took in stride
They are back in demand
 I was the one who was washing
Blood of your hands


 Don't you cry tonight
I still love you baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There is a heaven
Above you baby
And don't you cry tonight


 I know the things you wanted
They are not what you have
With all the people talking
It is driving you mad

If I was standing by you
How would you feel
Knowing your
Love's decided
And all love is real
Baby




 I thought I could
Live in your world
As years all went by
With all the voices
I have heard
Something has died

And when you are in need
Of someone
My heart won't deny you
So many seem so lonely
With no one left
To cry to baby
