I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things
We can do the tango, just for two
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
Be your Valentino', just for you


 "Ooh love, Ooh lover boy
What're you doing tonight? Hey boy"
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned lover boy


Ooh let me feel your heartbeat (, faster)
Ooh can you feel my love heat? (Ohh)
Come on and sit on my hot-seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after-all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing
Say the word, your wish is my command




When I'm not with you
Think of you always
I miss you (I miss thosenights)
When I'm not with you
Think of me always
Love you, Love you
Hey boy where do you get it from?
Hey boy where did you go?
I learned my passion in the good old
Fashioned school of lover boys




 Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, 9 o'clock) precisely
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours, that will be fine (Come on and get it)


 "Ooh love (there he goes again)
Ooh lover boy (who's my goodlover boy wohh wohh)
What're you doing tonight, hey boy"
Everything's all right, just hold on tight
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned (fashioned) lover boy
