Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
 Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight


You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We are just waiting
For the hammer to fall


 Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
 But lift your face, the Western Way
Build your muscles as your body decays




Tow the line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Untill one day they call your name
You know it is time for the Hammer to Fall
Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth it is all the same
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane
Baby now your struggle's all vain
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just want to scream it louder and louder




What the hell are we fighting for
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you are waiting for the Hammer to Fall
