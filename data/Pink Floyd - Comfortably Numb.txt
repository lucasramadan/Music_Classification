Just a little pin prick
 There'll be no more AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
But you may feel a little sick
 Can you stand up?
I do believe its working. Good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go

 
 There is no pain, you are receding
 A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
 You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
 When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look and it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
And I â€¦ have become comfortably numb
