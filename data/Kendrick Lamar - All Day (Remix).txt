All day ho, my neck look sweeter than parfait ho
 Rap Derek Jeter in a red two seater
I can throw this dick from far away ho
 Swish it, swish it, ask me how long do it take to be the greatest
 I'm the broadway ho, swish it, swish it
 Damn Kanye never will It be safe, bitch I already know
 Swish it, swish it, 24/7 365 days everybody gettin' paid
 Nigga lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJ's
Chitown, PJall of BJ
Chitown, we play for the freebase
 These days, don't believe what police say
 DJ's and the B-boys run shit
 Only way I can sum it up, son of a bitch

Talkin’ big face nigga
 Put yo ass back in pocket like a switchbladenigga, uh
I ain’t tryna play nigga
