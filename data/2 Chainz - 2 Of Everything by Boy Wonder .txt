Karate kid bitch, I got a lot of kick
 Smoking on that president, no politic
 Some niggas getting rich, ain’t got no common sense
 I woke up this morning I might buy your biz
If she look, look, look she get took, took
 Two cups, two blunts longer than your foot
 Hair long, money long,everything long
 I’m a rapper so I fucked her with my chains on
James Bond swag, check my watch and swerve
 Need a clock on my rims so they could watch the curve
I am high, so high I need a skyrocket
 And it look like a phonebook in my pocket

 
Two cups, two blunts
I am high, so high I need a skyrocket


 Yeah, it's 2 A.M. and I'm swishing through like two lanes
 Got two dames and they only in a two things
Got drugs and sex, and yeah, they want it in like two ways
 Enough to go around, they on that head like toupee
Young nigga, but I’m O.G
Like broke chain in two ways
You acting, I’m flexing
 Get lost bitch, like loose change
 Brought the son of a bitch that rock two chains
 Got diamonds all on my tooth, hey
 It's axed out, you assed out, for fashions I cast out
 I hit the runway, tell the cameraman to pose me up
 A couple bands every time a blogger post me up
 (bandz a make her dance)
She wanna day when I go and eat that girl for lunch
Get two of this, cop two of those and doubles, that’s my blunt




Man, we loose, lock the door
 Kick it like I’m wearing soccer clothes
Flex, nigga, stop and pose
I don’t rap, I do rock’n’roll
If she loud then she got to go
 Hoover Dam can’t stop the flow
Yeah, I'm popping, ho
Just put it in your mouthlike a popsicle
 Colder than an icicle, I ride on this beat like a bicycle
Chase ‘em in a mouse hole
 Fuck you wearing, nigga, South Pole?
 Take two shots of this Patron
 And take two hits of this bomb dro
 I'll leave you John Doe or drop you off in the Congo
 Last of the Mohicans, shout out to my Puerto Ricans
 Trinidad Jame$ flow ‘cause right now nigga I’m geekin'
Sweeping you shall find a hope, you find wherever you seeking
 Two cups, two blunts, two mollys and it’s turnt up all the way season
Flex


I fly so high I need a skyrocket
