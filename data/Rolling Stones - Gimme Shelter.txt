Ooh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
 If I don't get some shelter
Ooh yeah, I'm gonna fade away


 War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away


 Ooh, see the fire is sweeping
Our very street today
Burns like a red coal carpet
Mad bull lost your way




 Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away


 Rape, murder!
 It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away


 Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away
It's just a shot away


 The floods is threat'ning
My very life today
 Give me, give me shelter
Or I'm going to fade away
War, children, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away[x4]
 I tell you love, sister, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away[x3]
Kiss away, kiss away
