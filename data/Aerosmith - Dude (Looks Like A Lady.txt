Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady


 Cruise into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She's a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right
Backstage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody said
Forgive me if I seem out of line
 Then she whipped out her gun and tried to blow me away!


That, that dude looks like a lady[x4]


Never judge a book by it's cover
Or who you gonna love by your lover
Sayin' love put me wise to her love in disguise
 She had the body of a Venus, Lord imagine my surprise


 Dude looks like a lady


So baby let me follow you down (let me take a peek dear)
Baby let me follow you down (do me, do me, do me all night)
Baby let me follow you down (turn the other cheek dear)
Baby let me follow you down (do me, do me, do me, do me)


Oo, what a funky lady
Oo, she like it, like it, like it, like that
 Oo he was a lady!Yeah!




Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady [x4]
