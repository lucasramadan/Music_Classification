Backstroke lover always hiding 'neath the covers
 Untill I talked to my daddy he say
He said, "You ain't seen nothing
Untill you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changing your ways"
 I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I can reminisce
 Ah the best thing loving
With her sister and her cousin
Started with a little kiss, like this
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
 Singing hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle
You be swinging like you just didn't care
 So I took a big chance at the high school dance
 With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was fooling?
Cause she knew what she was doing
Taught me how to walk this way
She told me to


 "Walk this way, talk this way[x4]
Ah, just give me a kiss
Gimme some, gimme some, gimme some, yeah


School girl sadie with the classy kinda sassy
 Little skirt climbing way up her knees
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was looking at me
I was a high school loser
Never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbour
With a daughter had a favour
 Tookme just a little kiss, like this
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle
You be swinging like you just didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was fooling?
Cause she knew what she was doing
Told me how to walk this way
She told me to
