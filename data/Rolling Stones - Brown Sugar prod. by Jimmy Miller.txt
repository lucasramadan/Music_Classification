Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields
 Sold in the market down in New Orleans
 Scarred old slaver knows he's doing alright
 Hear him with the women just around midnight


 Brown sugar how come you taste so good
Brown sugar just like a young girl should- ah hum oh..
Woo!


Drums beating, cold English blood runs hot
 Lady of the house wonderin' when it's gonna stop
 House boy knows that he's doing alright
You shoulda heard him just around midnight




 Ah, get it on brown sugar, how come you taste so good, babe?
Ah, got me feelin' now for brown sugar, just like a black girl should yeah


 Now I bet your mama was a tent show queen
And all her boyfriends were sweet sixteen
 I'm no schoolboy but I know what I like
You shoulda heard me just around midnight




 I said yeah, yeah, yeah, woo!
How come you...how come you taste so good?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woo!
Just like a...just like a black girl should
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woo!
