I'M BACK!
I'M BACK in the saddle again
I'M BACK!
I'M BACK in the saddle again


Riding into town alone
By the light of the moon
I'm looking for all Sukie Jones
She crazy horse saloon
Barkeep give me a drink
That's when she caught my eye
She turned to give me a wink
That'd make a grown man cry




Umm...come easy, go easy
Alright until the rising sun
I'm calling all the shots tonight
I'm like a loaded gun
Peeling off my boots and chaps
I'm saddle sore
 Four bits gets you time in the racks
I scream for more
Fools and gold out of their mines
The girls are soaking wet
No tongue's drier than mine
I'll come when I get back


I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm riding, I'm loading up my pistol
I'm riding, I really got a fistful
I'm riding, I'm shining up my saddle
I'm riding, this snake is going to rattle




Riding high[x2]
Riding high already
