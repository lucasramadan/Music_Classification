Everytime that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
 The past is gone, it went by like dusk to dawn
 Isn't that the way, everybody got the dues in life to pay
 I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
 I know it's everybody's sin
 You got to lose to know how to win


 Half my life's in books written pages
 Lived and learned from fools and from sages
 You know it's true
 All the things come back to you


 Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away


 Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dream come true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dream come true


Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on


 Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away
