 This is what, this what they want huh
This is what it's all about
Time to take Affirmative Action son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean
Niggas coming sideways thinking stuff is sweet man
 Niggas don't understand the four devils; lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

 
 Yo sit back, relax, catch ya contact, sip your cog-ni-ac
 And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
 Sneak attack a new cat sit back, worth top dollar
In fact touch mine's and I'll react like a Rottweiler
 Who could relate, we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch em and break, undress em, tie em with tape no escape
 The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
 Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
 We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
 Lower your tone, face it homicide cases get blown
 Aristocrats, politickin daily with diplomats
 See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

 
 Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
 That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
 That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
 Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
 Yo, my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up bring your heater all your cream go between us
 Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
 I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
 My red beam, made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
 Corleone be turning niggas to fiends
 Yukons and ninja black Lexus, Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it


 Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
 I shine jewelry sipping on crushed grapes, we lust papes
 And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening, he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
 My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
 Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
 Life's a bitch but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
 I'll be flooded with ice so hell fire can't scorch me
 Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque
 Moving cars, your top papi Se√±or Escobar


 In the black Camaro
 Firm deep, all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
 Wallabee's be the apparel
 Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
 In the Lexpushed by my nigga Jungle
 E Money bags got Moet Chandon
 Bundle of sixty-two
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
 My whole team, we shitting hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
 I keep a fat marquess piece
Laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
 Be The Firm baby, from BK to the Bridge
 My nigga Wiz
 Operation Firm Biz
So what the deal is
 I keep a phat jew-el, sipping Crist-ies
 Sitting on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
 We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
 The Gods they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
 Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
 On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Baba Shallah spoke
 Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke, raw though
An ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper
 He had a fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait it's half-and-half
 Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half
Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki
The Firm baby, volume one
