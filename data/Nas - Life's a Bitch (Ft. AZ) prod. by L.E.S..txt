Aiyo what's up what's up let's keep it real, son
Count this money, you know what I'm sayin'
(Yeah yeah)
 Aiyo put the Grants over there in the safe you know what I'm sayin'
Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
 (I'm sayin' that's what this is all about right
Clothes, bankrolls and hoes you know what I'm sayin'
Yo then what man, what)

 
 Visualizing the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
 I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
 Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as 5 Percenters
But something must've got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
 Now some resting in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
 Others such as myself are tryna carry on tradition
 Keeping this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
 Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
 Even though we know somehow we all gotta go
 But as long as we leaving thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough, so
 Until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
 Keeping it real, packing steel, getting high
Cause life's a bitch and then you die

 
 Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go
 Life's a bitch and then you die
 That's why we puff lye
 Cause you never know when you're gonna go

 
 I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
 My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created
 Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
 Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
 Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
 When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin foreigners take they wallets, they jewels, and rip they green cards
 Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
Got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
 Now it's all about cash in abundance
 Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
 I switched my motto; instead of saying "fuck tomorrow"
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
 Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
 Time is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
 Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage
