You need cooling, baby, I'm not fooling
 I'm going to send you back to schooling
 Way down inside honey, you need it
I'm going to give you my love
I'm going to give you my love


Want a whole lot of love [X4]


 You've been learning, baby, I've been yearning
All them good times, baby, baby, I've been learning
Way, way down inside honey, you need it
I'm gonna give you my love... I'm going to give you my love



 


You've been cooling, baby, I've been drooling
All the good times I've been misusing
Way, way down inside, I'm going to give you my love
 I'm going to give you every inch of my love
Going to give you my love




Way down inside... woman... You need... love
 Shake for me, girl. I want to be your backdoor man
Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh!
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
