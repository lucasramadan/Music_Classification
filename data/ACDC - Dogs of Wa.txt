Dogs of war


You've been a fightin' man
Let go, I guess you can
Don't need to feel your touch
[?] the lights
Taking all you can
Rich game ain't in the plans
 Feel the boots upon the ground
Trouble brewing all around


 Dodging the bullets
Shooting the missiles
Soldiers of fortune
Searching for their name
Face the game
Mercenary fame


We'll be the dogs of war (Soldiers of fortune)
We'll be the dogs of war (Soldiers of fortune)
Call in with dogs of war (Soldiers of fortune)
Send in the dogs of war (Soldiers of fortune)


 I'll fight, fight in the night
Run away or die of fright
Keeping time and keep in line
When there's smoke, there's fire


 Dodging the bullets
Shooting the missiles
Soldiers of fortune
Searching for their name
Face the game
Mercenary fame


We'll be the dogs of war (Soldiers of fortune)
We'll be the dogs of war (Soldiers of fortune)
Call in the dogs of war (Soldiers of fortune)
Send in with dogs of war (Soldiers of fortune)




We'll be the dogs of war (Soldiers of fortune)
We'll be the dogs of war (Soldiers of fortune)
Call in the dogs of war (Soldiers of fortune)
Send in with dogs of war (Soldiers of fortune)
