EM-HO woody
When I sit in the seat
Because I'm ready, so ready
I got a girlfriend with the hoochy-coochy eyes
Because in the pink she look so fine
 She's got the cracker jack now all I want's the prize
Yeah
I know these hookers down on 42nd street, but
Ill-gotten booty's not my style
I'll take a rain check until I get back on my feet
Yeah


Because I'm
Alright
Your mamma says I'm
Alright
Your daddy says I'm
Alright
And my old lady says I'm
Alright


Whip cracking floozy
Way out of control
She got a new kinda jelly
In her jelly roll
 I got the right key baby
But the wrong keyhole
And I'm ready, so ready
I'm a red hot pistol
And I'm ready to fight
 I'm a 38 special
On a Saturday night
I'm going to kiss your boo-boo honey
Make it alright
Because I'm ready, so ready
 I got a cruiser with a bimbo on the dash
It kinda keeps my ass in line
One little french kiss honey that's my kinda trash
Honey
My brand new baby's looking f-i-n-e, FINE
The sun is shining every day
 I've got no rubbers now it's raining all the time
Honey


But I'm
Alright
My little sister says I'm
Alright
Ohh my brother thinks I'm
Alright
And my old lady know I'm
Alright


I feel like I'm hung up on the line
I'd die for you but we were partners in the crime
Everything about you is so f-i-n-e, FINE
Let's put our clothes back on
And by the way girl
What's your name again?


But I'm
Alright
Your daddy says I'm
Alright
 And Tipper thinks I'm
Alright
 And Joe Perry says I'm
Alright


 Pitched my tent
In the pouring rain
 I got a back seat lover
That's calling my name
She going to blow my cover
She's hot as a flame
But I'm ready, so ready
 I shove my tongue
Right between your cheeks
I haven't made love now
For twenty-five weeks
I hear that your so tight
Your loving squeaks
And I'm ready, so ready
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
