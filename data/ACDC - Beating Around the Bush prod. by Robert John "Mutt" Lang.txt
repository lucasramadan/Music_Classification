Smiling face and loving eyes
But you keep on telling me all those lies
How do you expect me to believe
Honey I isn’t that naive
Baby I got my eye on you
But you do all the things that I want you to
Stop your crying and dry your tears
I isn’t that wet behind the ears


 You can throw me left
And you can throw me right
The way we do this night
Beating around the bush


Wish I knew what's on your mind
Why you're being so unkind?
Remember those nights you spent alone
Talking on the telephone?
Thoughts of you go through my brain
You told me that you felt the same
You told me that you love me too
Tell me who would lie with you?


I was talking birds
And you was talking bees
And he was down upon his knees
Beating around the bush


 You're the meanest woman I've ever known
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
I know what you're looking for
You ate your cake, you want some more
I'm going to give you just a one more chance
Try to save our romance
Done everything I'm going to do
The rest is up to you


You can chew it up
And you can spit it out
Let it all hang out
Beating around the bush
