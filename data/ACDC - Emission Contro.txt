Here's my mission
To seek you out
You're up for grabs, honey
Breathe in, don't make a sound


Get up
Get high off the ground
Give it up
Not fooling around
Breaking it up

Raising it up
Six guns to the sky


 Come in emission control
Emission control
Come in emission control
Emission control
It's good for the soul, yeah


Turn on emission
The engine comes alive
She takes [?]
Like a lion ready to strike (ready to strike)


Hold it up
Take [?]
Hold it up
You got to raise it on high
Reaching it up
You can't be [?] shy
Reaching it up
Six guns to the sky
Giving it up
Giving it up



[Outro] x2
Giving it up
Giving it up
Raising it up
