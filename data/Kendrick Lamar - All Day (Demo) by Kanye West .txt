And you ain't gettin' money 'less you got eight figure, uh
(Talkin' big face, nigga
 Put yo' ass back in pocket like a switchblade, nigga, uh
I ainâ€™t tryin' to play, nigga)
Got a middle finger longer than 'Kembe, my nigga, uh
All day, nigga, 'Ye in the buildin' like a hallway, nigga
Still got the hundred with the small face, nigga
Might spend fifty racks on my off-day, nigga
Might spend fifty nights in the all-day thicker
If you run (*mumbles*), have Allstate with ya
Uh, you a Rico Suave nigga
Ride-around-listen-to-Sade nigga
Ridin' around 7 and it's all 'Ye, nigga
You a actor, you should be on Broadway, nigga
Cause you do shit the broad way, nigga?
 Your bitch got a ass, but my broad way thicker
Hit 'em, but they thinner than the Broadway
In an Impreza, they ain't Brooklyn like the Barclays Center, uh

 
(I feel like it, all day like it
All day, nigga)
 I took a young sweet breath and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed
At that moment I dispersed

I took a young sweet breath and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed
At that moment I dispersed

 
All day, ho, my neck look sweeter than parfait, ho
Rap Derek Jeter in a red two-seater
I can throw this dick from far away, ho, swish it, swish it
Ask me, "How long do it take to be the greatest?"
I'm in Broadway ho, swish it, swish it
Damn, Kanye, never will it be safe
Bitch, I already know, swish it, swish it
 24/7, three sixty-five days, everybody gettin' paid
Nigga lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJs
Chi-Town, PJ, all of BJ
Chi-Town, we play for the freebase
These days, don't believe what police say
Deejays and the B-boys run shit
Only way I can sum it up, son of bitch


(I feel like it, all day like it)
So watch this, eh, ay-e-ay-e-eh


*Whistles*
(Little darling, let me run
Until I find myself in the morning sun
And give me freedom, give me space
I want to find myself in a special place)
