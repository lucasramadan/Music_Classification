Get down make love


You take my body
I give you heat
You say you're hungry
I give you meat
I suck your mind
You blow my head
Make love  Inside your bed
Everybody get down make love




Every time I get hot
You want to cool down
Every time I get high
You say you want to come down
You say it's enough
In fact it's too much
Every time I get a - Get down, get down
Make love


I can squeeze - You can shake me
I can feel - when you break me
Come on so heavy - when you take me -
You make love, you make love, you make love, you make love
You can make everybody get down make love
Get down make love


Every time I get high
You want to come down
Every time I get hot
You say you want to cool down
You say it's enough
In fact it's too much
Every time I want to, get down, get down get down
