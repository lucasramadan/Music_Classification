This is for the hood, this is for the ghetto
 This is for the niggas getting that money
 That cash money, that 100 million dollar money
 We got money
 We the best


 Ridin' big, gettin' mine
 Two microwaves flip a brick at a time
Bandanna on the handle ready for the whip
When I wear the whitest soft watch it disappear
 I disappear in the middle of the night
When I reappear, bet the boss look so bright
For life, dough boy
More strikes, oh boy
 We ridin' low, gettin' high
 80 round drum let ya know the time
 When you see the Maybach, niggas know it's mine
 Ridin' on the 2-4'sI'm ahead of my time
Watch runnin' from kind, another one on my mind
 Phone bill 4 grand get your ho on my line
 In the hood, ho niggas act funny
 Only real niggas really get to touch cash money


I spent 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
 And I came from the ghetto (ghetto), and I came from the ghetto (ghetto)
 If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto

 
 Everyday a new whip homie, So you know I gets my shine on
 Flip after we flip homie, So you know I gets my grind on
 Birdman daddy, Pullin up in the brand new Cadi
 Got money, living lavish, Got bitches, shipping package
 Move them things, Get them things, Switch that lane
 Get that chain, Flip them thangs, Get yo money hommie do your thing
 See I got em like 10 times, spend money got em like 10 times
Flip that got em like 10 times, Got money like 10 more times nigga




 I'm from the ghetto, the bottom, the hood, the slums
 There's money out here, we just trying to get some
 Cool like Dre nigga, A like K
When ya talk about me you better watch what ya say
 Don't ever keep them things where ya lay
 Cuz them pussy ass niggas show the folks where ya stay
 Ya thought he was ya dog, said he was a G
Sounds like another co-defendant to me
 Niggas move sloppy and I really don't like it
 Fuck around and get everybodyindicted
 Saw this shit coming, you woulda thought I was a psychic
 Fuck around go dead broke trying to fight it


 I, I, I all night it, I every day it
 And when it comes to my dues, I over payed it
 Rated hood bitch, Bitch I'm hood bitch
 I ain't a asshole, but I'm on some hood shit
 I wish I would switch, I don't know how
 Blood gang swarm like a red ant pile
 Mean mug, like I can't smile
 Like my grill didn't, Cost me a 100 thou

I smell a lot of 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto (ghetto), and I came from the ghetto (ghetto)
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up, If ya ghetto, throw ya hood up
If ya ghetto


 Cash Money Millionaires, Cash Money Billionaires, Cash Money Trillionaires
We rich
We ain't never gone stop, never
We got money nigga
