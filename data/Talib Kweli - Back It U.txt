These niggas soft man, they sweeter than glucose
Gimme fifty feet homie or you too close
Personal space nigga back it up
Beep beep, back it up
Beep beep, back it up
Wait a minute

These niggas soft man, they sweeter than glucose
Gimme fifty feet homie or you too close
Personal space nigga back it up
Beep beep, back it up
Beep beep, back it up
Wait a minute

 Ayo my penmanship fucking up your face like a bleamish do
 Keep it banging like red and blue
The instrumental through
Killing shit, you ain’t got a chance
You and your man is through
Inspiration, ran into my music like xanadu
You rolling through, with a rent a crew
And a rented crew
Ten of you, way too many dudes
Soft as betty boo
Steady you, talking all that shit
In them interviews
Annie who? shit is pitiful
I had to get at you
 Spit at you, like it’s 2Pac at the camera
You ain’t got no hammers bruh, talking streetsweepers
You a muthafucking janitor
I’m the realest nigga that you ran into
 Can it bruh, the shit you spit faker than the tits on Pamela Anderson
Catch me in the Manderin, post it up
Ghetto’s near you, catch a close up
I walk through any hood like respect it
Cause the flow tough, grow up
Personal space homie, back up
