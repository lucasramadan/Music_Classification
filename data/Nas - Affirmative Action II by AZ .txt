Check it, uhh
Protect this, nigga for the necklace
I throw the death wish; the pretty slim sex shit
The rep this, remember Fox said this
We on some next shit, we are blessed this
 The scares on our backs mean we met this
 To lie for 'em
The 25 sentence to keep my eyes on 'em
I'm straight, knowing when Allah's shine on 'em
Shitty drugs and drama, opposite three pretty thugs and a don momma
Filling the rest, the steel in their chest
When Boogs threw the kiss of death, it was over
And we laid out, chill I was open off the way he ate out
It was real, fo'real I was fucking with mills and he was frag-ile
We wyling, the brown stallion
Stay styling, on the low fouling
The whole Firm wyling, we lucked it
I know the trick bitch he fuck with, on some duct shit
Heard through the grade that she sucked it
Firm, Sosand Esco, mad loco
 Fox and Mega for whatever,and through this cheddar
 We gon' stay family, 'til we fry though
The fam will never split even if one of us die though
Along with our get go's, we gon' blaze 'til it brick-o's
Peep the Ill-Na-Na, sweet taboo
The Firm tattoo on the Dada
Now tell me what crew hold it down like we do da da?


' Til the death of this, murderous moves pursue effortless
 Ice necklace, high priced dressed executives
 Peep the grammar, slim built, strong stamina
Forty-four nickel plate long with the silencer
Play for keeps in shut eye you stay sleep
Shit remain deep in get shells thrown at ya Range jeep
 Giuliani sweep got all the kings going up the creek
Devil life beers now who's left controlling the streets?
No intelligence, strictly slow niggas minds negligence
 It's evident, Feds vest up, raid ya residence
We're all for living, heavyweight Firm division
Mind, I check mine. Eating swine is against my religion
You know the steez, take aim, cock and squeeze
 It's the prophecies, not the philosophies of Socrates
Next up? (Yo I believe that's me)
Ayo Mega, represent for the family


 Ayo, the Feds got me in the top ten
Cause when my door got knocked in
My four-four main cocked in
 My sinister mind, shines like a Dillinger
 Mega exhausted, Babyface crime Emperor
Yo, life is based on cultures and creeds
And peep the way drug fiends, the thug nigga sees
I've seen niggas lined up, handcuffed and tied-up
 Coke prices rise up when drugs supply dry-up
The Millennium drives up
Rims semi blinds ya eyes temporarily
 Mind of Mega be heavily armed for felonies
Shine you could never see
The next fat cat out of NYC
 It Was Written like ghetto life hieroglyphics
Living since my real niggas bailed me out of prison
A lot of schemes, cause the narcotics team in Queens
Had marked dollars then the knowledge of fiends
 My dream is the legacy of Montana treasury
Fake thugs couldn't even take slugs or bury me


 To all thoroughbreds taking the corners, y'all need to join us
Firm's most powerful nation of rap performers
 High class, Generals, Confidence, paying lawyers
 Swift as Oscar De La Hoya, green beret warriors
 Fakes I peep them like the J. Kennedy tape
In the new with Jew busting all in the face
Another word yo, you see through
My man built the Sugar Hill from a sweet tooth
We all eat, cause I speak truth and educated
Black youth, street diploma
 Teach Greeks and Romans, but the legacy was stolen
It's a Firm thing, generally gleam
 I wrote the theme on how to sell a million
While you crabs is mad at your promotion team
 I roll with the nicest Fox
 Black ice, pushing Benz without a license
Gear tight as vice grips, Nas got 19 wifies
Seven shiesty, nine of them pisces
 Three white meatsunder tight cheese
 Wilding, big links is heavy like bricks
That you throw on a pit-bull neck's while feeding 'em raw steak
It's core take, more cake
 I take the crown of the so called king of the town and lock it down
