"What we've got here is
Failure to communicate!
Some men you just can't reach!
So, you get what we
Had here last week!
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
And I don't like it any
More than you men."


 Look at your
Young men fighting
Look at your
Women crying
Look at your
Young men dying
The way they've a
Always done before


 Look at the hate
We're breeding
Look at the fear
We're feeding
Look at the lives
We're leading
The way we've
Always done before


 My hands are tied
 The billions shift
From side to side
 And the wars go
On with brainwashed pride
 For the love of god
 And our human rights
And all these things
Are swept aside
 By bloody hands
Time can't deny
And are washed
Away by your genocide
 And history hides the
Lies of our civil wars


 D'you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said peace
Could last forever
 And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
 I went numb when
I learned to see
 So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of
D.C. to remind us all
 That you can't trust freedom
When it's not in your hands
 When everybody's fighting
For their promised land


 And I don't need
Your civil war
 It feeds the rich while
It buries the poor
 Your power hungry
Selling soldiers
In a human grocery store
 Isn't that fresh
I don't need your civil war


 Look at the shoes
You're filling
Look at the blood
We're spilling
Look at the world
We're killing
The way we've
Always done before
Look in the doubt
We've wallowed
Look at the leaders
We've followed
 Look at the lies
We've swallowed
And I don't want
To hear no more


 My hands are tied
For all I've seen has
Changed my mind
But still the wars go on
As the years go by
With no love of god
Or human rights
Cause all these dreams
Are swept aside
By bloody hands
Of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross
Of homicide
And history bears the scars
 Of our civil wars


 We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and Government officials
For example, we create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer


I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while
It buries the poor
Your power hungry
Selling soldiers
In a human grocery store
Isn't that fresh
And I don't need
Your civil war
I don't need your civil war[x2]
Your power hungry
Selling soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war
 I don't need one more war
 What's so civil about war anyway?
