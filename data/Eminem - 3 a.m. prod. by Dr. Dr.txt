There is no escaping, there's no place to hide
You scream someone save me, but they don't pay no mind
Goodnight, goodbye

 
 You're walking down a horror corridor
 It's almost four in the morning and you're in a, nightmare it's horrible
 Right there's the coroner, waiting for ya
To turn the corner so he can corner ya, you're a goner, he's onto ya
 Out the corner of his cornea, he just saw ya run
 All ya want is to rest cause you can't run anymore, you're done
 All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
 Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
 Contemplating my next plot again, swallowing a Klonopin
 While I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
 Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom and
Make sure I got all of it, wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must'a just blacked out again, not again


 It's 3 a.m. in the morning, put my key in the door
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must'a killed 'em, killed 'em

 
 Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
 I wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs
 Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana
 Then I reach for the aloe and Lanolin
 Bust all over the wall panelin'
 Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantle and
 Grab my flannel and my bandana then kiss the naked mannequin man again
 You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
 I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causing illusions again, brain contusions again
 Cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors and pins
 Jesus, when does it end?
 Phases that I go through, dazed and I'm so confused
 Days that I don't know who gave these molecules to
Me, what am I gon' do? Hey, the prodigal son
The diabolical one, very methodical when I slaughter them



 
 She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again


 I cut and I slash, slice and gash
 Last night was a blast, I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half pint of the Jack
 My last Vic and a half, a fleshlight of Kim Kardashian's ass
 I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
 December, I think it was: I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights, pushed him into the stinkin' tub
 Cut him up into pieces and just when I went to drink his blood
I thought I oughta drink his bath water, that oughta be fun
 That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
 The sight of blood excites me; that might be an artery, son
 Your bloodcurdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
 It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
 A secret passageway around here, man, there's gotta be one
 Oh no, there's probably none, he can scream all that he wants
 Top of his lungs, but ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up
