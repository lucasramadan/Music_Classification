I try and feel the sunshine
You bring the rain
You try and hold me down
With your complaints
You cry and moan
And complain
You whine an tear
Up to my neck in sorrow
The touch you bring
You just don't step
Inside to 14 years
So hard to keep
My own head
That's what I say
You know
I've been the beggar
I've played the thief
I was the dog
They all tried to beat


But it has been
 14 years
Of silence
It's been
14 years
Of pain
It's been
14 years that
Are gone forever
And I'll never have again


 Your stupid
Girlfriends tell you
That I'm to blame
Well they're all
Used up has-beens
Out of the game
This time I'll have
The last word
You hear what I say
I tried to see it your way
It won't work today
You don't just step
Inside to 14 years
So hard to keep
My own head
That's what I say
You know
 I've been the dealer
Hangin' on your street
I was the dog
They all tried to beat




Bullshit and contemplation
Gossip's their trade
If they knew
Half the real truth
What would they say
 Well I'm past the
Point of concern
It's time to play
These last 4 years of madness
Sure put me straight
You don't get back 14 years
In just one day
So hard to keep
My own head
Just go away
You know
 Just like a hooker she said
Nothin's for free
 Oh I tried to see it your way
I tried to see it your way
