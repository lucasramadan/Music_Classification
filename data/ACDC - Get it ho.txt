Going out on the town
Just a me and you
Going to have ourselves a party
Just like we use to do
 Nobody's playing Manilow
Nobody's playing soul
And no one's playing hard to get
Just a good old rock 'n' roll


Get it hot, get it hot
Come on baby, get it hot
Get it hot, get it hot
Alright


Moving down the motorway
Got a whole lot to booze
Got myself a sweet little (mother mamma)
Whose got nothing to lose
Going to bend you like a G string
Enough to light my fire (conduct you like a choir)
So get your body in the right place
We'll set the world on fire
