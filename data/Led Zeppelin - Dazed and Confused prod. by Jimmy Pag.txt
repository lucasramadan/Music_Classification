Been Dazed and Confused for so long it's not true
 Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
 Lots of people talk and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below


 You hurt and abuse telling all of your lies
Run around sweet baby, Lord how they hypnotize
 Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been
Gonna' love you baby, here I come again
 Every day I work so hard, bringing home my hard earned pay
Try to love you baby, but you push me away
 Don't know where you're going, only know just where you've been
 Sweet little baby, I want you again


 Been Dazed and Confused for so long it's not true
 Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
 Take it easy baby, let them say what they will
Will your tongue wag so much when I send you the bill?

 
 If you're going to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco
You're gonna meet a lot of gentle people there
