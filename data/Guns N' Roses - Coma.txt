Hey, you caught me in a coma
And I don't think I want to
Ever come back to this... world again
Kinda like it in a coma
Because no one's ever going to
Oh, make me come back to this... world again


Now I feel as if I'm floating away
I can't feel all the pressure
And I like it this way
But my body's calling
My body's calling
Won't you come back to this... world again

Suspended deep in a sea of black
I've got the light at the end
I've got the bones on the mast
Well, I've gone sailing
I've gone sailing
I could leave so easily
While friends are
Calling back to me
I said they're, they're
Leavin' it all up to me
When all I needed was clarity, and
Someone to tell me
What the fuck is going on

Goddamn it


Slipping farther and farther away
It's a miracle, how long we can stay
In a world our minds created
In a world that's full of shit

 Help me
"Okay, let's get this guy in the program please, we're losing him." "Start an IV Please."
Help Me
"Come on... His airways.. someone's got to protect his airways. I want two..."
"Where's the defibrillator?"
"Two IV's over here please. That's two more now. We're losing him"
"Let's go"
Help Me
"Slow motion here. This guy's going..."
Bastard
"Let's get him in ER"
"...Going out on us"
"Who's got the defibrillator?"


Please understand me
I'm climbing through
The wreckage
Of all my twisted dreams
But this cheap investigation
Just can't stifle all my screams
And I'm waiting
At the crossroads
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Where are you

No one's going to
Bother me anymore
No one's going to mess
With my head no more
I can't understand what
All the fightin's for
But it's so nice here
Down off the shore
I wish you could see this
Because there's nothing to see
 It's peaceful here
And it's fine with me
Not like the world where
I used to live
I never really wanted to live


 I know
"Okay, we're starting to lose this guy. I want that IV and his airway protected!"
"Let's get some people in here!"
"Get the crash cart please, we're losing this guy. He's going..." "Give me an airway please"
"... Going under."
"Clear"
Zap him again
"How about an IV, stat?"
"Okay... you better protect the airway, you're starting to lose him." "clear!"
Zap the son of a bitch again

 "Listen to me"
"Axl, are you listening to me?"
"Don't walk away from me!"
'You are such a fucking prick, I am so pissed with you"
"Get back over here!"
"All I hear is bullshit, all the time"
"All I hear from you is sex, sex sex"
"I just dont give a shit anymore"

 "I love you"


You live your life like it's a coma
Won't you tell me why we'd wanna
With all the reasons you give it's
It's kinda hard to believe
But who am I to tell you that I've seen
Any reason why you should stay
Maybe we'd be better off without you, anyway

You got a one way ticket
On your last chance ride
Gotta one way ticket
To your suicide
Gotta one way ticket
And there's no way out alive

An all this crass communication
That has left you in the cold
Isn't much for consolation
When you feel so weak and old
But if home is where the heart is
Then there's stories to be told
No, you don't need a doctor
No one else can heal your soul

Got your mind in submission
Got your life on the line
 But nobody pulled the trigger
They just stepped aside
They be down by the water
While you, watch them waving goodbye

They be calling in the morning
They be hanging on the phone
They be waiting for an answer
But you know nobody's home
When the bell's stopped ringing
It was, nobody's fault but your own

There were always ample warnings
There were always subtle signs
And you would have seen it coming
But we gave you too much time

 And when you said that no one's listening
Why'd your best friend drop a dime
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting
For a way to spend our time

 And "it's so easy" to be social
"It's so easy" to be cool
Yeah, it's easy to be hungry
When you ain't got shit to lose

And I wish that I could help you
With what you hope to find
But I'm still out here waiting
Watching reruns of my life
When you reach the point of breaking
Know it's gonna take some time
To heal the broken memories
That another man would need
Just to survive
