Her man's been gone
For nigh on year
He was due home yesterday
But he ain't here


Down your street your crying is a well-known sound
Your street is very well known, through out your town
 Your town is very famous for the little girl
Whose crying can be heard all around the world
Oh


We have a remedy
You'll appreciate
No need to feel so bad
He's only late
 We'll bring you flowers and things
Help pass your time
We'll give him eagle's wings
Then he can fly to you


Fa la la la la la

Fa la la la la la
Fa la la la la
Fa la la la la la
Fa la la la la la

We have a remedy
Fa la la la la la la
We have a remedy
Fa la la la la la la

Fa la la la la la la
We have a remedy
Fa la la la la la la


We have a remedy
We have!
Little girl guide, why don't you stop your crying?
Here comes Ivor the engine driver to make you feel much better


My name is Ivor
I'm an engine driver
I know him well
I know why you feel blue
Just cause he's late
Don't mean he'll never get through
He told me he loves you
He ain't no liar, I ain't either
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver
Let's have a smile for an old engine driver


Soon be home [x2]
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home
We'll soon be home
Soon be home
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home

Come on, old horse


Soon be home [x2]
Soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home


Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang
 Cello cello cello cello cello cello cello cello
I can't believe it
Do my eyes deceive me?
Am I back in your arms?
Away from all harm?


It's like a dream to be with you again
Can't believe that I'm with you again
 I missed you and I must admit
I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the Engine Driver's lap
And later with him, had a nap
You are forgiven, you are forgiven, you are forgiven




You are forgiven
