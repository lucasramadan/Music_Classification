Yes, yes, y'all and you don't stop
To the beat y'all and you don't stop
Yes yes, y'all and you don't stop
1, 2, y'all and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all and you don't stop
And to the beat Com Sense'll be the sure shot, come on

 
 I met this girl, when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school, when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
 On the regular, not a church girl she was secular
 Not about the money, those studs was mic checkin' her
 But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
 A few New York niggas, had did her in the park
 But she was there for me, and I was there for her
 Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out and listen to her
 Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her
 Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
Cause we related, physically and mentally
 And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
 Slim was fresh yo, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister
Boy I tell ya, I miss her

 

 
 Now periodically I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
 She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick
 Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
 Out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads medallions
 She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
 About my people she was teachin' me, by not preaching to me
But speaking to me in a method that was leisurely
 So easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
 But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool
 Cause around the same time, I went away to school
 And I'm a man of expanding, so why should I stand in her way
 She probably get her money in L.A
 And she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the pro-black, was going out of style
She said, Afrocentricity, was of the past
 So she got into R&amp;B, hip-house, bass, and jazz
 Now black music is black music and it's all good
 I wasn't salty; she was with the boys in the hood
 Cause that was good for her, she was becoming well rounded
 I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
 Just having fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung



 
 I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
 Once the man got to her, he altered her native
 Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
 That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
 Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
 She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, looking rock and dressin' hippie
 And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city
Talking about popping Glocks serving rocks and hittin' switches
 Now she's a gangsta rolling with gangsta bitches
 Always smoking blunts and getting drunk
 Telling me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
 Stressin' how hardcore and "real" she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
 I did her, not just to say that I did it
 But I'm committed (giiirl, he's committed), but so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same letting all these groupies do her
 I see niggas slammin' her, and taking her to the sewer
 But I'ma take her back hoping that the shit stop
 Cause who I'm talking 'bout, y'all, is hip-hop
