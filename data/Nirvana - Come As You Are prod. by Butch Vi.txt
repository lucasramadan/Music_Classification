Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As a known enemy
 Take your time, hurry up
The choice is yours, don't be late
 Take a rest as a friend, as an old


Memoria, memoria
Memoria, memoria

 
 Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
 As I want you to be
 As a trend, as a friend
 As a known enemy yeah

 


 And I swear that I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
