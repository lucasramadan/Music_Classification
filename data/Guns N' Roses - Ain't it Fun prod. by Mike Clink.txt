Isn't it fun when you're always on the run
Isn't it fun when your friends despise what you become
Isn't it fun when you get so high
Well...that you, you just can't come
 Isn't it fun when you know that you going to die young


 It's such fun
Good fun
Such fun
Such fun
Aah such fun
Such fun
Such fun aah
Yeah fun
Just fun
Such


 Isn't it fun when you taking care of number one
Isn't it fun when you feel like you just got to get a gun
 Isn't it fun when you just can't seem to find your tongue
Because you stuck it too deep into something that really stung
It's such fun, ah

Well, so good to me, they spit right in my face
I didn't even feel it
It was such a disgrace


 I punched my fist right through the glass
I didn't even feel it
It happened so fast




 Isn't it fun when you tell her she's just a cunt
Isn't it fun when you she splits you and leaves you on the bum
Well, isn't it fun when you've broken up every band that you've ever begun
 Isn't it fun when you know that you're going to die young
