What else should I be?
All apologies
 What else could I say?
Everyone is gay
 What else should I write?
I don't have the right
 What else should I be?
All apologies


 In the sun, in the sun
I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, buried


 I wish I was like you
Easily amused
 Find my nest of salt
 Everything is my fault
I'll take all the blame
 Aqua seafoam shame
 Sunburn, freezer burn
 Choking on the ashes of her enemy


 In the sun, in the sun
I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, buried
Married, buried
Yeah, yeah, yeah ,yeah

All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are
All in all is all we are

[Krist Novoselic]: Passing a basket
[Kurt Cobain]: I even asked David Geffen personally if he'd buy it for me. He wouldn't do it
