He lost his mind today
He left it out back
On the highway
On 65


 She loved him yesterday
Yesterday's over
I said okay
That's all right
 Time moves on
That's the way
We live in hope to
See the next day
That's all right


Sometimes these things
They are so easy
Sometimes these things
They are so cold
 Sometimes these things just
Seem to rip you right in two
Oh no man don't
Let them get to you


She loved him yesterday
 He laid her sister
 She said okay
And that's all right
 Buried her things today
Way back out deep
Behind the driveway
And that's all right


 Sometimes these
Women are so easy
Sometimes these
Women are so cold
Sometimes these women
Seem to rip you right in two
Only if you let them get to you
You get out on your own
And you take all that you own
And you get about your home
And then you're
Just fucking gone
There's no logic
Here today
Do as you got to
Go your own way
I said that's right
Time's short your
Life's your own
And in the end
We are just
Dust and bones[x2]


That's all right
Dust n' bones


That's alright
