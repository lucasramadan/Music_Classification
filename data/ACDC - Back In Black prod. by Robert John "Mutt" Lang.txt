Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
 Yes I'm, let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I keep looking at the sky cause it's getting me high
 Forget the hearse cause I'll never die
 I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Using every one of them and running wild


Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well I'm back in black
Yes I'm back in black


 Back in the back of a Cadillac
 Number one with a bullet,I'm a power pack
 Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
Cause I'm back on the track and I'm leading the pack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So look at me now I'm just making my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way


Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well I'm back in black
Yes I'm back in black




Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well I'm back in black
Yes I'm back in black




Hooo yeah Ohh yeah
Yes I am Oooh yeah
Yeah Oh yeah
Back in now
Well I'm back, I'm back Back
I'm back Back, I'm back Back, I'm back Back
I'm back Back Back in black
Yes I'm back in black
Outta sight
