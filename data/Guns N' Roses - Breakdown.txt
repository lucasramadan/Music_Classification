We all come in from the cold
We come down from the wire
An everybody warms themselves
To a different fire
When sometimes we get burned
You would think sometime we could learn
 The one you love is the one
That should take you higher
You have got no one
You better go back
Out and find her


 Just like children hiding in a closet
Can't tell what is going on outside
Sometimes we are so far
Off the beaten track
We will get taken for a ride
By a parlor trick or
Some words of wit
A hidden hand up a sleeve
To think the one you love
Could hurt you now
Is a little hard to believe
But everybody darling sometimes
Bites the hand that feeds


When I look around
Everybody always
Brings me down
Well is it them or me
Well I just can't see
But there isn't no peace to found
 But if someone really cared
Well they would take the time to spare
A moment to try and understand
Another one's despair
Remember in this
Game we call life
That no one said it's fair


Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Yeah
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Get down with yo' bad self
Alright


 I have come to know the cold
I think of it as home
When there isn't enough of me
To go around
I would rather be left alone
 But if I call you out of habit
I am out of love and I gotta have it
Would you give it to me
If I fit you needs
Like when we both knew we had it
 But now the damage is done
And we are back out on the run
 Fun how everything was roses
When we held on to the guns
 Just because you are winning
Don't mean you are the lucky ones




 There goes the Challenger
Being chased
By the blue blue
Eanies on wheels
The vicious traffic
Squad cars are
After our lone driver
The last American hero
The-the electric sintar
The demi-god
The super driver
Of the golden west
Two nasty nazi cars
Are close behind
The beautiful lone driver
The police cars are getting
Closer closer
Closer to our soul hero in his
Soul mobile yeah baby
They about to strike
They gonna get him
Smash rape
The last beautiful free
Soul on this planet


But it is written
If the evil spirit
Arms the tiger with claws
Brahman provided
Wings for the dove
Thus spake the super guru
Did you hear that
