Yo, I'm trying to be the man of the day, three-six-five a year
 See the bullshit you saying, Skam ain't trying to hear (Fuck that!)
 Busting lyrics in the air, keeping some up in the chamber
 (Yo Skam, what the fuck you doing?) Man, I'm releasing anger!
( I'm trying to be the illest of the day, three six five a year
See that bullshit you saying, Shady ain't trying to hear
Spitting lyrics in your ear, keeping some up in the chamber)
Aiyyo Shady what the fuck you doing? (I'm releasing anger!)


 Man I'm tired of being tired, every time I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of being late for the bus
Tired of all be blending, and ending up dating sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up!
 To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up
 Gold digging bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fitting, girl leave that shit alone
 You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
 I rip your tissue out your ear, spitting like I don't care
 My hair look like I ain't comb it, shit a damn near year
 So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
 Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the ho now
 At every industry party, getting so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
 Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Trying to roll up on Miami, leaving with a broke neck
Oh shit, lethal lyric equal land mind
 I be stacking up white rappers like I'm throwing gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposing the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fucking shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jamming like three up in the chamber
(Yo Skam what the fuck you doing?)




 "I just wanna figure something in my head
And maybe you can help me out here
When a person is insane, as you clearly are
Do you know that you're insane?
And you're just sitting around reading Guns &amp; Ammo
Masturbating in your own feces
Do you just stop and go
"Wow, it's just amazing how fucking crazy I really am"?"

 
 Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
 Came late to the last show with a different dame
 Brain ate from the last O' that I sniffed of 'caine
 You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
 When your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
 So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
 Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
 Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
 I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
 So when Slim gets this M-16 bursting
 You getting spun backwards like every word of obscene cursing
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
 Stopping your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock block your father's game
 I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
 So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
 And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'mma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out
