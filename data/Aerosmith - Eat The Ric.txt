Well, I woke up this morning
On the wrong side of the bed
And how I got to thinkin'
About all those things you said
About ordinary people
And how they make you sick
And if callin' names kicks back on you
Then I hope this does the trick
Cause I'm sick of your complainin'
About how many bills
And I'm sick of all your bitchin'
'Bout your poodles and your pills
And I just can't see no humour
About your way of life
And I think I can do more for you
With this here fork and knife


 Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; take one bite now - come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; take one bite now, spit out the rest


So I called up my head shrinker
And I told him what I'd done
Said you'd best go on a diet
Yeah I hope you have some fun
 And a'don't go burst a bubble
On the rich folks who get rude
Cause you won't get in no trouble
When you eats that kinda food
Now their smokin' up the junk bonds
And then they go get stiff
And they're dancin' in the yacht club
With Muff and Uncle Biff
But there's one good thing that happens
When you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit
But go real good with wine




Believe in all the good things
That money just can't buy
Then you won't get no belly ache
From eatin' humble pie
I believe in rags to riches
 Your inheritence won't last
 So take your Grey Poupon my friend
And shove it up your ass!


Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; take one bite now - come back for more
Eat the rich; don't stop me now I'm going crazy
Eat the rich; that's my idea of a good time baby
