Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dream
 I am a traveler of both time and space, to be where I have been
 To sit with elders of the gentle race, this world has seldom seen
 They talk of days for which they sit and wait
When all will be revealed

 Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
 But not a word I heard could I relate, the story was quite clear
Oh, oh

 Oh, I been flying... mama, there ain't no denying
I've been flying, ain't no denying, no denying

 All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

 Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
 Like thoughts inside a dream
Heed the path that led me to that place, yellow desert stream
 My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

 Oh, father of the four winds,fill my sails
Across the sea of years
 With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh



When I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah
 Ooh, yeah-yeah, oh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down
Ooh, yeah-yeah, oh, yeah-yeah, but I'm down, so down
 Ooh, my baby, oh, my baby, let me take you there


Come on, let me take you there...let me take you there
