Oh baby, pretty baby
Oh honey, you let
Me down honey
I am not playing
Childhood games
No more
I said it's time for me
To even the score
So stake your claim
Your claim to fame
But baby call another name
When you feel the fire
And taste the flame


Back off, back off bitch
Down in the gutter
Dying in the ditch
You better back off
Back off bitch
Face of an angel with
The love of a witch
Back off, back off bitch
Back off, back off bitch


Making love
Cheap heartbreaker
Broken backed
Nasty ballbreaker
Stay out of
My bed, outta my head
If it's loving you
I'm better off dead




Emotions ripped
Gone on a binge
Life lipped, I said
You're off the hinge
Telling lies of such
Fame and glory
I don't even want to
Hear your story




Hey what do you think he's trying
To say there, anyway
I think it's something
Each person's
Supposed to take in
Their own special way
Fucking bitch
