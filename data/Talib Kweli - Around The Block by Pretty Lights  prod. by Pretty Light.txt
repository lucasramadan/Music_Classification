My goddess, eh
The byproduct of New York City nights
 When you criticizin' you caught up in all the pretty lights
 Getting high in my city is like requirement, it's my environment
 I wonâ€™t harp on it like a violin
Analog back in the house like a [?]
Posted up like a fan on the block
Hand to god, word is bond
Right now its the best moment you ever known
You gotta make it your own
Lets take her home
