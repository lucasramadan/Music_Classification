Don't damn me when I speak
A piece of my mind
 Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
 Cause I've been
Where I have been
And I've seen
What I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
Cause it's all a part of me

 Be it a song
Or casual conversation
To hold my tongue speaks
Of quiet reservations
Your words once heard
They can place you in a faction
 My words may disturb but
At least there's a reaction

 Sometimes I wanna kill
Sometimes I wanna die
Sometimes I wanna destroy
Sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I could get even
Sometimes I could give up
Sometimes I could give
Sometimes I never give a fuck

It's only for a while
I hope you understand
I never wanted this to happen
Didn't want to be a man
So I hid inside my world
I took what I could find
I cried when I was lonely
I fell down when I was blind

Don't damn me when I speak
A piece of my mind
Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
Cause I've been
Where I have been
And I've seen
What I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
Cause it's all a part of me

How can I ever satisfy you
And how can
I ever make you see
That deep inside
We're all somebody
And it don't matter
Who you wanna be

But now I gotta smile
I hope you comprehend
For this man can say it happened
Cause this child
Has been condemned
So I stepped into your world
I kicked you in the mind
And I'm the only witness to
The nature of my crime

 But look at what we've done
To the innocent and young
 Whoa listen to
Who's talkingcause
We're not the only ones
The trash collected by the eyes
And dumped into the brain
Said it tears into
Our conscious thoughts
You tell me, who's to blame

I know you don't
Wanna hear me cryin'
And I know you don't
Wanna hear me deny
That your satisfaction
Lies in your illusion
But your delusions
Are yours and not mine

We take for granted
We know the whole story
We judge a book by its cover
And read what we want
Between selected lines

Don't hail me and
Don't idolize the ink
Or I've failed in my attentions
Can you find the missing link
Your only validation
Is living your own life
Vicarious existence is
A fucking waste of time

So I send this song
To the offended
I said what I meant and
I've never pretended
As so many others do
Intending just to please
If I damned your point of view
Could you turn the other cheek

Don't damn me when I speak
A piece of my mind
Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
Cause I've been
Where I have been
And I've seen
What I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
Cause it's all a part of me

Don't damn me
I said don't damn me
I said don't hail me
Don't damn me

Smoke 'em
If you got 'em
Alright
That sucked
