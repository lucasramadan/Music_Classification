Your style is generic
Mines authentic made
 I roll like a renegade
You need clinic aid
 My technique is bizarre and ill;
I scar and kill
 You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
 As I proceed to cook and grill ya
That’s all that took to kill ya
 You better recognize me like I look familiar
You want to battle
 You beat around the bush
Like you're scared to lick pussy so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push
Someone that I can bully
Wait a minute I don’t think you understand fully
 See me without a style
Is like mustard without the Hienz’s
 I lead the new school
 You a BUSTA without the RHYMES
 I crush the shit out your lines
