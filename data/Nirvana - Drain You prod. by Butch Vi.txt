One baby to another says
I'm lucky to have met you
 I don't care what you think
Unless it is about me
 It is now my duty to completely drain you
 I travel through a tube
And end up in your infection


 Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you


 With eyes so dialated
I've become your pupil
You've taught me everything
Without a poison apple
The water is so yellow
I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful
Vacuum out the fluids

 
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you
You

 

YEAHHHH!

I travel through a tube
And end up in your infection

 Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
Sloppy lips to lips
You're my vitamins
I like you
