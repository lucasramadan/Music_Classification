As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
 Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life
 As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
 Wonderin’ if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night
 As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 100 things to do before I die

 
 Couple niggas on the hitlist and bitches on a different type
 Same shit different nights, till I live a different life
 Sean you looking tired, damn homie that’s all
I’ve been stressin’ so hard I’m surprised I ain't going bald
 Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into ya’ll, hatin’
 I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
 Niggas wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug
 From where they move the drugs, Buddha love
 Niggas sleepin with that mac and I ain't talkin’ bout computer love
 Owe the wrong people you a price tag
 Now you pray to God hoping that you got a Christ tag
 Make it where I’m from, stay who I become
 Time to raise hell, Satan ain't my son
 Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there too




 If I just stop breathing
Even though I got all this muthafucking money
Won't keep my heart beating
 Just don’t wake me up
 Don't wake me up
 You can’t catch me dreaming
Bout all of this muthafucking money
 Cocaine rush, I’m speeding
Cocaine rush


 I’m just a Detroit nigga, nothing extra about me
 I go extra hard at the first second you doubt me
 I strive for perfection at the same time
I’m accepting the fact that there’ll never be nothing perfect about me
 Shit, I’m just waiting on a win
Come up with better hooks
The hoes’ll take it on the chin
 We are 6 mile bred
 That's why you see our sick style yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
 Momma happy at me, Daddy happy at me
 The baddest chicks' y'all can imagine is chatty yapping at me
 5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
 Now I’m Cali swagging , my nigga listen, I’m over the fame
 You number 1, I’m number 23, my mission is take over the game
 You rollin’ with lames, we ain't rolling the same
 I’m the best out in this muthafucker
 If I could get a cheque out of this muthafucka
Big enough to set my kids up for life
 I could check out of this muthafucka with no regrets
 If you ain't living your life for your kids
I ain't giving yo ass no respect
 Sean I love you my nigga, I’m out




 I gotta break your fucking heart
 I gotta climb these fucking charts
I gotta do something that’s innovative
Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part
 I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia’s momma
 Breakfast in bed is head with plenty of Carne Asada
 I gotta find me a wife to elope
 I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
 I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
 But those who lied to the minority will make em turn inside they grave
 I can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me
 I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth
 Need to know every detail about this Earth
The devil controls it
 So before you scrutinize how I feel
Ask God if them polls important
 The end is near
