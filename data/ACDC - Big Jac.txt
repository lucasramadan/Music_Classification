The Steam is a burning
Working up and down the line
The pot is getting ready
He's been working it so hard
When it comes to loving
Big jack is on his way
Wink of satisfaction
His time is going on
I am like a bad defender
 Smoking holy joe
He is a big pretender
Look out for jack


He's on his way
Big Jack
Big Jack
You know it's only natural
He gets you up to scratch
Big Jack
Big Jack
You have got a reputation
You really got the knack
Big Jack
Big Jack
 He said that he's the only one
Who got a full sack
Big Jack
Look out Jack
He's always at your back


You never leave a dollar
Racking up the balls
You like to get it on fast
Back there standing tall
When he hears the siren
He is going to put you on the racks
He got a bad reputation
Climbing all over the bars
Going to press the flesh
Rocking rolling soldier
He's the last of them all
Well tell Jack
