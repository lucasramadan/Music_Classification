Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 mile road

I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back

8 mile road, and I'm gone, I know right where I'm going
Sorry mama I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't following no footsteps, I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 mile road
