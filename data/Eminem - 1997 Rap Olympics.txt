I'mma tell you this for your own benefit
Your shit was dope as hell, specially when you wrote 90% of it
 What you need to do is practice on your freestyles
'fore you come up missin' like Snoop Dogg's police files
This type of shit? bitch be sure that I'm spittin'
 Be hittin', you gonna pray to God this shit was written
 But it wasn't I'll kill a dozen rappers when I buzzin'
 Guzzlin', beat your ass like a jealous husband
Now whos ya boy? bitch you about to suffer and see north
 When you go in a coma longer than Vladamir Konstastinov
 Cut the damn machine off
 Get a clean cloth, and wipe this bloody video screen off

 _________________________________________________________________

I'm movin' in for the kill, plus I got the trap set
 I can tell you're wack as fuck, and I ain't even hear you rap yet
 Look at you thinkin I'm about to whip his ass
Cause I'm a do some written shit, plus I get to go last
 Well guess what ? even if I go first, it's no worse
My shit's still gon' demolish yo verse
I'm bout to slice you like a ginsu
 And anything you say can and will be used against you
In a court of law, I'm short and raw
 Take you fuckin' shit and cut it off
 Yo, you wanna be a dope MC?
Look, don't get mad and start taking your period out on me

_________________________________________________________________

 You wanna represent on the microphone but you rap sleazily
 I ain't about to battle this fake ass Eazy-E
 There ain't no way I'm a do this bullshit
 I don't give a fuck, I'm loaded up with a full clip
Time of the month, you couldn't get the tape of the day
 Take him away, I ripped him like a paper mache
 I've heard you rap before, you ain't about shit
 This whole battle was mismatched like your outfit
 Try to battle me and get your mouth split
 You sold out like Ticketmaster Outlet
Ha ha, I bust and I crush, I don't give a fuck
Ain't no way that you can fuck with us
 I'm givin back with pimp shit
I'll laminate that ass in a badge and wear it at the Rap Olympics

_________________________________________________________________

 Blah-badee-blah-da-blah-blah, stop babblin'
You so fuckin' wack I'm a walk away while you battlin'
 Fuck that, I'm on a brand new solo mission
 To make sure that Wendy Day kicks your ass out of the rap coalition
 I throw a switch at an execution
 With an overdose of devotion don't talk back, I'm the dope, bitch
 So who you sound like on the mic?
 There was only one 2Pac, your thug style's just one Big Syke
 Take a big hike, bitch you can't catch me
 Your best rhymes still ain't shit like a patsy
 What the fuck you gonna do?
 I'll battle anybody in your crew and I don't give a fuck
I slaughter boys, especially wack ass emcees
 That will wear a fake ass corduroy

_________________________________________________________________

 I'm bout to make this mic short circuit
This beat is wack as fuck, this shit fits you perfect
 I got so many ways to diss you that I'm playful with'ch you
 I'll let a razor slit you 'til they have to staple stitch you
 And everybody in this fuckin' place'll miss you
If you try to turn my facial tissue to a racial issue
 Nobody's hearin' you, you're a wack liar
 Damn, all you white jokes just backfired
 Cause bitch you walkin' up the wrong street
Now go tell all your boys you was beat by a honkey
 I don't give a fuck, I'll kill ya, bitch
 You better recognize me like a look familiar
 Anything you say I'm a kill ya, grill ya
When I fuckin' drill ya I'm Marsh but you're the one that's mellow
