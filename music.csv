And even the gringos


Yo, check it
One for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forthcoming live future shock
It's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell,8 Million Stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keep in orbit with the probable tenth
The universe expands length
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide project-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor: better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the ""cha-pow!"" You dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got, 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits ever see my pockets like
69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like
Nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a ki
A 5-minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right: ""You Are Not Alone""
Rock your hardhat, black, cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation
This new math is whipping motherfuckers' ass
You want to know how to rhyme you better learn how to add
It's mathematics


""The Mighty Mos Def""""it's simple mathematics""
""Check it out""""I revolve around science..""
""What are we talking about here?""
""Do your math""
""1, 2, 3, 4""
""What are we talking about here?""


It's one universal lawbut 2 sides to every story
3 strikes and you be in for life, mandatory
4 MC's murdered in the last 4 years
I ain't trying to be the fifth one, the millennium is here
Yo it's 6 Million Ways to Die, from the 7 deadly thrills
8-year olds getting found with 9mils
It's 10 P.M., where your seeds at?What's the deal?
He on the hillpumping krillto keep they belly filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn their next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get C.R.E.A.M
The white unemployment rate? It's nearly more than triple for black
Some front-liners got their gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still living
Join the other 5 million under state supervision
This is business: no faces, just lines and statistics
From your phone, your zip code to S-S-I digits
The system break man, child, and women into figures
2 columns for ""who is"" and ""who ain't niggas""
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back?
Here's the secret
The million other straws underneath it:it's all mathematics",rap,,,,Mos Def,"Back Home by A$AP Rocky  (Ft. Acyde & A$AP Yams) prod. by A$AP Rocky, DDot Omen & Thelonious Martin",http://genius.com/A-ap-rocky-back-home-lyrics,"
Gotta find my way back home, I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home, I'm moving...


War Lords, we all Lords, but we your Lords
Tryna find home, next stop is the Waldorf
Past the racism and fake-ism
Type of hate that make you feel worse than a rape victim,raw dogs
You other niggas mad soft, mad I rap my ass off
They throwin' mad salt, 'til I go bath salt
On wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off
I'm Mr. Miyagi in Issey Miyake
Asshole flow, fuck name brands, past logos
Now I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh
It's like my fashion style is the life saver
Guess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
Head so good on that girl that I might pay her, or nah
Super laid back cat, opposite of fat black, Al Capone
Tell them lil' niggas Flacko home


Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long


Father, Lord forgive me as I load up the semi
Roll through the city, that chose to resent me
Hold it, don't load it, reload it
On plenty, any foe or a-BEEP-
That ever voted against me, dissed me
Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst of luck that ever hated
Never hesitated, the designated, all of the wrong that they did me
Is stored in my memory all of the thoughts that I thought of
Means more for my enemies
Sippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys
Load the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories
Make a toast for the henny, it's the best for the remedies
Energy, synergy, frienemies, industries
Finna get advantage on him and his nemesis
Bitches been sniffing
If I, if I ain't the greatest, bitch I'm one of em
Howin the fuck could you front on em
My old ho beefing, my ex won't be friends
Bronson told me not to eat ham,rest in peace Yams


Rest in peace Yams,RIP A$APYamborghini
We gon' take it uptown one time
We gon' take em back home, show em how me do
They call me Pretty Flacko ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to introduce Pretty Flacko Sr
Yasiin Bey


Magnum spectacular, black man megalas
Shine amethyst, fly champion, it's like that again
What's happening? Mathematics master blin'
Flacko season, all day, erryday
Ask me how it's going, I tell em on and on and on and on and
You led me out to Arizona
Steady flowing, staying golden
Sand cover, ready rover
Flacko glowing in that Owens, that's how it's going
Awareness to the areas, familiar with the routes
Travellin' man, moving through places, space and time
In a country called earth


Nah'mean, these tacky ass muh'fuckers be in the pictures.Wearing all types of mother fuckin' red and green stripes, over accessorizing out this mother fucker.We from Harlem, we gave y'all mother fucker this wave.

For one moment, that it's too soon to forget


Man, duke I was in love with this girl, duke
I was tore up dog, I'm telling you man
Shit is wild man, for real
It's, she's from, let me tell you about her


In she came with the same type game
The type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi,shot me a glance
In that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants,hot damn!
What's your name love, where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The swims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leaving now""
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She sipping Cris straight up, shaking, winding her waist up
Scene 2: my fam throwing the jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
""Ayo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce""
I turned around (Say word!) it was the same pretty bird
Who I had priorly observed trying to play me for the herb
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feeling? ""Oh, I'm fine"" My name is Mos ""I'm Sharice""
I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sitting directly next to me
I'm type polite but now I'm looking at her skeptically
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fucking with me mentally
We conversated, made her laugh, yeah, you know me bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, ""How you gon' leave before you dance with me?""




She blew my whole head with that duke, I was like, word?
I played it low though, I was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go
Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell ya
Yo, honey was so blazing she was just
Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy,word bond, to my mother man
She was that ill man, she take me to the dance floor
And she start whispering to me and shit


""Yo, let me apologize for the other night
I know it wasn't right, but baby you know what it's like
Some brothers don't be coming right, I understand, I'm feeling you
Besides, can I have a dance ain't really that original""
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playing Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered, ""Honey, let's exchange numbers""
Scene 3: weeks of dating late night conversation
In the crib heart racing, trying to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smiling, singing Gregory Isaacs
Like, ""If I don't, if I don't have you""
Showing me her tan line and her tattoo
Playing Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burning candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., come now, I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks,rocking the P-funk
Cocking her knees up, champion lover not ease up
Three months, she call I feel I'm running a fever
Six months, I'm telling her I desperately need her
Nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really trying to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart I got to have it
She telling me commitment is something she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic
Ahh, damn it, my shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, I saw Sharice at the Kittie club
With some banging ass Asian playing lay it down and lick me up

""It just took up the whole car?""
""Yeah yeah, it was a whole car and shit...""

Escuchela.. la ciudad respirando


The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shining, like who on top of this?
People was tussling, arguing and bustling
Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustling
I'm wrestling with words and ideas
My ears is pricked, seeking what will transmit
The scribes can apply to transcript, yo
This ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive,let's describe the inscrutable
The indisputable, we New York the narcotic
Draped in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips
For profits, thirsty criminals take pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches
Skyscrapers is colossus,the cost of living is preposterous
Stay alive, you play or die, no options,no Batman and Robin
Can't tell between the cops and the robbers, they both partners, they all heartless
With no conscience, back streets stay darkened
Where unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbing
You either make a way or stay sobbing
The shiny Apple is bruised but sweetand if you choose to eat
You could lose your teeth,many crews retreat
Nightly news repeat, who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight to savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative rose to explain this existence
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance


So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out,weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving


Breathin in deep city breaths, sittin on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, hell froze the night the city slept
The beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicatin with one another
And ghetto birdswhere waters fall
From the hydrants to the gutters
The beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin
You on the wrong side of the track, lookin visibly shaken
Taken them plungers, plungin to death that's painted by the numbers
With Krylon applied pressure,cats is playin God
By havin children by a lesser baby mother but fuck it
We played against each other like puppets,swearin you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Gettin knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everything is fair
It's a paradox we call reality
So keepin it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally like, Mickey and Mallory
Not knowing the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceeing to illustrate what we be seeing
Hard to be a spiritual being when shit is shakin what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm asking if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded
My blood pressure boiled and rose,cause New York niggas
Actin spoiled at shows,to the winners the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife the Roman Empire state



[Spanish speaking woman] Escuchela.. respirando ??


Yo...on The Amen, Corner I stood lookin at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixin down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I choreograph seven steps to heaven
In hell, waiting to exhaleand make the bread leaven
Veteran of a cold warIt's Chica-I-go for
What I know or, what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib I spend months gone
Sat by the window with a clutched dome listenin to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord, but didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own
Outta the city, they want us gone
Tearin down the 'jects creatin plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Ask my guy how he thought travellin the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep

Things are so passionate, times are so real
Sometimes I try and chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke
Smile on my face but it's really no joke
You feel it in the streets, people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down their focus
The focus gettin' clear and the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometimes you don't hear me
I push it past the bass, know nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black I'm so wide awake
That I hardly ever sleep, my flows forever deep
And it's volumes or scriptures when I breathe on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm everywhere: penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral of a shell
Universal ghetto life, holla black you know it well
Quiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across
Soul is the lions roar, voice is the siren
I swing round, ring out and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'
Suckas trying to hide like the struggle won't find 'em
And the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him
Everywhere penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, talk'll lead you on a shell

Carrying laundry, ""What's wrong G? Hungry?""
""No, gimme my oil or get [fuck] out my country""
And in Arabian barkin' other stuff
'til his moms come grab him and they walk off in a rush
Distrust, feeling like I've pissed upon wound
I'm like, ""Surely hope that we can fix our differences soon!"" Bye!
Buying apples I'm breakin' on
You take everything, why not just take the damn food, black monster?Like I don't understand it, on another planet
15 month of this stuff, how I'm gonna manage?
And increasing the sentiment, gentlemen
Getting down on their middle eastern instruments
Realized trapped in this crowd
Walk over kicked one of my fabulous raps (la dee da dee)

Harder work on this side making truth magnify
Devils can't stop me, but they damn sure try
Shine the light on the Earth that receive and radiate

(Somalian(America))


There are some things pure while certain things blur
Dilute it with the lie and you believe when it occur
Falsified information got my people in the stir
We have to be in search of something equal to the cure
Straight out the door, I come to give you more
Lay the law keep it raw, when I speak it from the core
Get underneath your skin like especially with the claw
Conflicted with the rich cuz I kick it with the poor
I laugh in the face of adversity
Sound clashed with the bass cuz its natural to me
But if you pay attention to the past you will see
Not long ago you black they'd hang your ass from a tree
Certain things things change, while some stay the same
Some are recluse others are lovers of the game
I'm trying to walk the lane, the Sirat al-Mustaqim
Instead of doing things they keep you covered in the flame

By Mos Def
February 1999

An Open letter From Mos Def...
Diallo was a West African immigrant with no prior criminal record who was shot and killed by police in the dark of night for simply being black. He was unarmed and shot at 41 times!No unarmed man should be shot at even once!One of the police officers involved in the Diallo shooting was involved in the killing of Patrick Bailey no more than a year and a half ago!Tyesha Miller was shot in her car in Los Angeles while she had a seizure!I could go on and on with the names of black people who have been killed at the hands of police just this year. But the list is so long that it would turn this letter into a statistic sheet.

Most of the people that got killed by police this year and in the past have probably been some of your fans; fans of some of your favorite artists.They are black people who love us, who defend us, who protect us, who put us in our comfortable homes an dour luxury sports utility vehicles and our well kept hotels suites and our oversized tour buses. They're the people that buy our records, our t-shirts, our concert tickets, and so on, and so forth.They're the same people that are getting murdered, harassed, maimed, and beaten in streets all over the world everyday!

The only people in our community who have not responded to this incident are us. Hip-Hop made one hundred billion dollars last year!...A lot of those dollars came from the 'Comptoms',the 'Brooklyns',the 'Crown Heights', the 'Chicagos', the Detroit ghettos, the St. Louis ghettos... the same ghettos where police run around literally hunting black folks to murder... then cruise the streets shortly thereafter with impunity and arrogance.

We are the Senators and the Congressmen of our communities.We come from communities that don't have nobody to speak for them. That's why they love us. Because we talk about what nobody else will talk about. We represent them. And they need to know that we really represent them. Not when it's just a romantic notion or a paycheck attached to it. When something happens to them it matters to us, because when something happens to them it's happening to us.Because Amadou Diallo is your brother, your cousin, your man...Tyesha Miller is your sister, your aunt, your girl, your wife, your daughter... All of these people are you! You are no different!And just because we're at the top of the Billboard charts, seen on MTV daily, livin' comfortably doesn't mean that we can't get shot, we can't be harassed, we can't be maimed and mistreated.

I hope this is as important to you as it is to me cause when I pass by the projects and when I pass by the hood I don't see nobody but me. I see everybody who looks like me. I see me many years ago as I'm sure many of you do. So it's time for us to come together from the 'jiggy' to the 'hardcore'; from the 'backpacker' to the man with the Lexus and really unite and show the world that we got strength. Show the world who we are. Represent who we are. Who we really are and where we really come from. Let's show people where our heart is... that we haven't forgotten.

Now I'm askin' you and anybody who looks on this letter to come forward and show your heart, to show your love, to love the people who love you back by speaking out against the injustices that they suffer. Because believe me, if the clock was turned backwards we'd be those same people.

Please stay mindful of this. Please be considerate of this letter. Pass it around! Talk about this! Think about it! Keep it on your mind because if you don't... it's going to keep its mind on you.

I wanna thank everybody for taking time out to read this letter. I hope I didn't take up too much of your time. All of the contact information and other information you need to know is enclosed.

I want to wish everybody, each and everyone of ya'll peace, prosperity and love.

Peace,

Appears a curious celestial phenomenon
Called Black Star, but what is it?


Black people unite and let's all get down
We got to have what? We got to have that love


What is the Black Star
Is it the cat with the black shades,the black car?
Is it shinin from very far, to where you are?
It is commonplace and different
Intimate and distant
Fresher than an infant


Black, my family thick,like black strap molasses
Star, on the rise, in the eyes of the masses
Black is the color of my true love's hair
Star's are bright, shining, hot balls of air


Black like my baby girl's stare
Black like the veil that the muslimina wear
Black like the planet that they fear, why they scared?
Black like the slave ship belly that brought us here
Black like the cheeks that are roadways for tears
That leave black faces well traveled with years
Black like assassin crosshairs
Blacker than my granddaddy armchair
He never really got no time to chill there
Cause this life is warfare, warfare


Deep on the front lines, and blacks is all there
Black like the perception of who, on welfare
Black like faces at the bottom of the well
I've been there before
To bring the light and heat it up like la cocina
Make without imagine happen but maybe I'm just a dreamer
I love rocking tracks like John Coltrane love Naima

Like the student love the teacher
[T] Likethe prophet love Khadija
Like I love my baby features
Like the creator love all creatures


Who are knowledge, truth, and peace seekers
We on point like heat seekers
Targettin the black marketing strategists
Run up on em with the heaters
Everybody followin with no leaders
Feelin like we killin ourselves
Because I know they can't defeat us
It don't stop til we complete this, keep this fly
There's so much to life when you just stay black and die


Blacker than the nighttime sky of Bed-Stuy in July
Blacker than the seed in the blackberry pie
Blacker than the middle of my eye
Black like Fela man cry
Some man wan ask ""Who am I?""
I simply reply, ""The U.N.I., V.E.R.S.A.L. Magnetic""
Work to respect the angelic
Climb the mountain top and tell it'til the valley's enveloped
You're full of big chat but you nah know me
I'm dark like the side of the moon you don't see
When the moon shine newly

[M] You know who else is a Black Star? (Who?) Me
[T] You know who else is a Black Star? (Who?) Me
[A] You know who else is a Black Star, who we? (And we)
[A] be shinin and shinin, when we rhymin and rhymin
We be shinin and shinin, when we rhymin and rhymin


Now everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two
It's the third eye vision,
The, is gonna shine bright tonight
It's the third eye vision,

[T] You know the light
[M] Go from the dark
[T] The other way is ass-backwards
[M] It's absurd
[T] Make you wanna crow like a blackbird
[M] That's right
[T] You livin from your first day to your last night
[T] Sometimes you show your ass like
Lint on your clothes
[T] When you froze in
[A] THE BLACK LIGHT
[M] Dead that
[T] Before you get your head wrapped
[M] Like Badu
We see through your voodoo
Just like Eve's Bayou, you dealin with that black magic
[M] Try to civilize you
[T] Notwalk on by you
[M] Like Sybillies do get you black listed, it'll
Be unlucky for you like a black cat
[M] A panther
[T] Revolution is the answer
[M] That's what we need
Greed plague my people like the cancer
[M] True indeed


Now black people unite, and let's ALL GET DOWN
Now everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two
It'sthe third eye vision,
The, is gonna shine bright tonight
Everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two
It's the third eye vision,
The, is gonna shine bright tonight
It's the third eye vision,
Equalin up to eight, light shine bright",rap,,,,Mos Def,"A Tree Never Grown (Ft. A.L., Fre, Grafh, Jane Doe, Jean Grae, J-Live, Kofi Taha, Rubix, Tame One & Wordsworth) prod. by 88 Keys",http://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-a-tree-never-grown-lyrics,"Yo, this is 88
This is for Amadou Diallo
Rest in peace, you still here


Yo, I'm in a brownstone singin like Brownstone
Bird's eye view of the bodega
No Omega like Rakim
Thinkin about brother Diallo
I find it hard to swallow
Cause 41 is a hard act to follow
Who is it, it can happen tomorrow
Goes down all the time in some African community
This one just hit closer to home
Cause it happened in our backyard
This that *shit* bring us closer to home
They ask ""What you writin fo'? What you writin on that paper fo'?""
Don't ask me nothing,just tell me
Who Howard Safir got it safer for, that's why my raps sour
My peoples screamin ""Black power!"" and ""La Raza!""
From the Bronx, police bustin, it's redemption time


Now on the squad car, CPR's supposed to be the motto
But in they minds, they be like ""Yo, I'ma do Diallo""
I guess master's noose was a bitter pill to swallow
Cause nowadays, tips ain't the only things that's hollow
Constitution, 41 more holes in it
And cops swingin sticks like they tryin to win the pennant
And stickin sticks places where they ashamed to admit it
But that's the straw that broke the camel's back
THEY GON' GET IT!!


Possessed by a nervous twitch and itchy writing finger
41 strokes through the barrel of pen for Amadou
More than a few of my personal friends
Since the beginning, it seems like it never ends
The story, ancient as biblical allegory and it's all gory
The Little Shop of City Hall Horrors
Who bakes infiltrate, agent, provocateur mission statement
Assassinate the Senate candidate, heavenly mandate


We proceeded on a country road
His mother's eyes withered swoll
Her child was never comin home
Said a prayer for his soul
As the coffin had closed, committed to the earth below
First seed she had sewn, would be a tree never grown
Shade that was never known
Who controls the Terrordome, the men with hearts made of stone
Who love only what they own


Stay on your toes for a troop whose description match
Blue suits, walkin round wit a stick and...
Ready to blast with the wrath of a hollow tip
And the fact is my taxes are scholarship
I feel it in my chest cavity
The only death's apathy, so I change it for who's next after me
And that's the fullest reward
Keep the face of the lost on my bulletin board


Yo yo, it's blue uniform, sirens, names, and badge numbers
Clubs, walkie-talkies, recipes for bad summers
Frisked, pissed after I tuck in my stuff
I really think they just like touchin my *nuts*
What's real stain they thoughts
Swear, but they won't say it in court
All they do is change the report
Riots, tryin to keep the crowd in control
They even got shows, Cops, LAPD, Highway Patrol yo yo


From the cradle to the grave, they made you a slave
Brainwashed to kill each other, that's the plague that they made
I search em like readin scripts that could save you today
White is right, black is wrong, that's the label they gave
Fryin in hell, applyin jails, they got you dyin in cells
Triple six in the mix, Levine to ?spell?
Prepare for the worst, and try to hope for the best
I take a stare at the hearse, can we cope wit the stress?


See I live in the land of plungers
Illegal chokeholds and excessive gunshots
Where there's one millionaire for every million empty pot
And Adolf Guili think we static but he's in for a shock
They come wit automatics but we flip it
Use the one, create the four Glocks and while stocks get washed
While school doors get locked and when jobs get blocked
The confi-dence get's rock
And when the welfare's drop into the jails we stock now
After Amadou wrestlin wit freedom tacks my mind into a headlock
But *fuck* H&amp;R, I'm a true cat
Refundin power back to our Blocks




Good life, you can bubble or struggle
But use your brain muscle if you hustle
Don't let nobody touch you
Don't even trust the ones that trust you
Cause the ones you showin love to might bust you
Seekin as a cancer, my man got shot by Haitians or Jamaicans
Confrontations and school my mind's racin
I pride these sensations over this, now I'm hopin this
We shine for, I never got a chance to rhyme for
My role models sold bottles and stole cars
And when they got locked, I accepted all the phone calls
That's when *niggas* was real
Back before I had a deal
Back when people called Villsburg Hooterville
ILL!!!


My mind wonders on melodic jams
An exotic bird, caged with the rage and the violence of my words
The same things I down I turn around and do
The white cops say nigga, but I say nigga too
Truth be told we hypocrites
In a materialistic society, spirituality shunned or
While young kinds get gunned on
Hibernatin in projects, which you project-ing
The pigs is crucifyin but Africans is resurrectin, Jane Doe


Pataki, sending cops to come and catch me
He better send a running back to run a track meet
When I'm running through the back streets
The rat teeth of beast loving the black meat
Eatin brothers like our pigment color is that sweet
To lock a man up in prison, the standard of living
Thinking they make a better brand of man
Than the man when he went in
Rub up a man for sinnin
Handcuff his hands to the system, banned from his wisdom
With insanity in him, his mind roams like a cyclone
Damagin victim, his eyes hold savage within him
Wrath with the venom, poison his life
No ointment to boisten the might
If it's on the left, walk to the right
Until death, do your part through your life
Like a boyfriend and wife, because the day times shorter than night
You know?

Things are so passionate, times are so real
Sometimes I try and chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke
Smile on my face but it's really no joke
You feel it in the streets, people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down their focus
The focus gettin' clear and the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometimes you don't hear me
I push it past the bass, know nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black I'm so wide awake
That I hardly ever sleep, my flows forever deep
And it's volumes or scriptures when I breathe on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm everywhere: penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral of a shell
Universal ghetto life, holla black you know it well
Quiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across
Soul is the lions roar, voice is the siren
I swing round, ring out and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'
Suckas trying to hide like the struggle won't find 'em
And the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him
Everywhere penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, talk'll lead you on a shell
Universal ghetto life, holla black you know it well


What it is, you know, they know
What it is, we know, y'all know
What it is, Ecstatic, there it is
What it is, you know, we know
What it is, they know, y'all know
What it is, you don't know? Here it is

And always on time and rockin ya mind


Sit and come relax, riddle off the mac
It's the patch,I'm a soldier in the middle of Iraq
Well say about noonish,comin' out the whip
And lookin at me curious, a young Iraqi kid
Carrying laundry, ""What's wrong G? Hungry?""
""No, gimme my oil or get [fuck] out my country""
And in Arabian barkin' other stuff
'til his moms come grab him and they walk off in a rush
Distrust, feeling like I've pissed upon wound
I'm like, ""Surely hope that we can fix our differences soon!"" Bye!
Buying apples I'm breakin' on
You take everything, why not just take the damn food, black monster?Like I don't understand it, on another planet
15 month of this stuff, how I'm gonna manage?
And increasing the sentiment, gentlemen
Getting down on their middle eastern instruments
Realized trapped in this crowd
Walk over kicked one of my fabulous raps (la dee da dee)
Arab jaw drop, they well wish, they glad rap
Now the kid considered like an Elvis of Baghdad

Means more for my enemies

Load the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories
Make a toast for the henny, it's the best for the remedies

You got to at least give me this one chance
I've been waiting all night
Don't be cruel girl it's only right
I've been watching and waiting
All night long
And now they're playing this song
And ya know
And ya know

(I've been wanting to know)

You got to take my hand
(Girl, speak yo' mind)
And give me this one chance
(Been thinking all of this time)
I can see it in your eye
(What I wouldn't do)
And baby I don't mind
(Oooh I)

It's a beautiful thing
Especially when we can rock and swing
When you're in my arms
I'm smelling your hair and feeling on your charms
Baby please come close
Don't let me go
Baby hold me tight
We can rock like this all night
I've been watching and waiting
All night long (so long)
And know they're playing this song
Oh baby baby

I cannot resist when you come my way
Your name Beauty In The Dark

You got to take my hand
And baby at least give me this one dance

You are the Beauty In The Dark
You got to take my hand
And baby baby please give me just one chance

I cannot resist when you pass my way

Beef is when the working folks can't find jobs
So they trying to find niggas to rob
Trying to find bigger guns so they can finish the job
Beef is when the crack babies can't find moms
Cause they in a pine box, or locked behind bars
Beef ain't the summer jam for Hot 9-7
Beef is the cocaine and AIDS epidemic
Beef don't come with a radio edit
Beef is when the judge is callin' you defendant
Beef: It come with a long jail sentence
Handed down to you in a few short minutes
Beef is when your girl come through for a visit
To tell you that she pregnant, by some other nigga
Beef is high blood pressure and bad credit
Need a loan for your home but you're too broke to get it
And all your little kids is doing is getting bigger
You're trying not to raise 'em around these wild niggas
Beef is when a gold digger got your seed in her
A manicure handout like, ""Pay me nigga!""
Or I'm telling your wife
Or starting up some foul rumor that'll ruin your life
Beef is when a gangsta ain't doing it right
And other gangstas is deciding what to do with his life
Beef is not what these famous niggas do on the mic
Beef is what George Bush would do in a fight
Beef is what Ja said to 50
But beef is all my homies not being here with me
When a soldier ends his life with his own gun
Beef is trying to figure out what to tell his son
Beef is oil prices and geopolitics
Beef is Iraq, the West Bank and Gaza Strip
Some beef is big and some beef is small
But what ya'll call beef is not beef at all

Bum a pill off of Paula like let me holler at you, mama

Now,come on y'all, get live get down
What we have is a brand new sound
So don't none of y'all just be misled
The De La's gonna do the body good like wheat bread

Shakin laces out of shoes, Mos Def brought the brews
Sittin indian squats to make that bread tie knots
See I'm out to get the coin like in them rainbow pots
Swingin life like a hammock, invested like stocks

Through your sinus complex, I aims to clog it up
Slappin fives with pain is a crew here to gain
We remain on your mind like skulls
Not a dull moment shown
When in the house all perimeters are blown

Native Tongue come through to make you say yes yes
This is the mighty Mos Def style fresh like baby breath

We are the killer combination with the size to administer
The beatdown toswell up all three of your eyes


Now this goes out to all area cliques

Life be nuttin but a river son I'm swimmin upstream

Playin wait up, with the data servin your ears
With information due to confirmation of the nation's most
Wicked ways of livin, like them glassy eyed beans
Inhale the smoke of fiends, while bangin the tape
Rated at the high point of the mass
Rippin MC's at the top of a class, occasionally
Rippin some sucker's face
Or some suckable ass from a girl
It's a big brother beat for the wide wide world

I'm makin memos off these demos back in eighty-nine
Took you all on encounters of an unknown kind (right)
Did the hustle with a couple of us, but soon noted
That my niggas buttered Benedict rolls, and then voted
I wrote in the dark so I could feel it like braille (uh-huh)
Heard the big brother beat, got locked with no bail
Came to set it like equators invented, with the heat
Yo Mos Def how you radiate to make it complete

Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga


I pledge no allegiance
Nigga, fuck the President's speeches
I'm baptized by America and covered in leeches
The dirty water that bleaches your soul and your facial features
Drowning you in propagandathat they spit through the speakers
And if you speak about the evil that the government does
The Patriot Actwill track you to the type of your blood
They try to frame you
And say you was trying sell drugs
And throw a federal indictment on niggas to show you love
This shitis run by fake Christians
Fake politicians
Look at they mansions
Then look at the conditions you live in
All they talk about is terrorism on television
They tell you to listen
But they don't really tell you they mission
They funded Al-Qaedaand now they blame the Muslim religion
Even though Bin Laden was a CIA tactician
They gave him billions of dollarsand they funded his purpose
Fahrenheit 9/11
That's just scratching the surface




They say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam
But that's bullshit
I'll show you why it's totally wrong
Cuz if another country invaded the hood tonight
It'd be warfare through Harlem
And Washington Heights
I wouldn't be fighting for Bush or White America's dream
I'd be fighting for my people's survival and self-esteem
I wouldn't fight for racist churches from the South, my nigga
I'd be fighting to keep the occupation out, my nigga
You ever clock someone who talk shit, or look at you wrong
Imagine if they shot at you
And was raping your moms
And of course Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons
We sold him that shit
After Ronald Reagan's election
Mercenary contractorsfighting a new era
Corporate military banking off the war on terror
They controlling the ghetto with the fear of attack
Tryna distract the fact that theyengineering the crack
So I'm strapped like Lee Malvo holding a sniper rifle
These bullets will touch your kids and I don't mean like Michael
Your body be sent to the morgue
Stripped down and recycled
I fire on house niggasthat support you and like you
Cuz innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily
And poor people never get shit and struggle daily
This ain't no alien conspiracy theory
This shit is real
Written on the dollar underneath the Masonic seal


I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President dead

So many hundreds in your pocket them bitches starting stick together
Took the penitentiary chances and I rolled with that shit

Two microwaves flip a brick at a time
Bandanna on the handle ready for the whip
When I wear the whitest soft watch it disappear
I disappear in the middle of the night
When I reappear, bet the boss look so bright
For life, dough boy
More strikes, oh boy

80 round drum let ya know the time
When you see the Maybach, niggas know it's mine
Ridin' on the 2-4'sI'm ahead of my time
Watch runnin' from kind,another one on my mind
Phone bill 4 grand get your ho on my line
In the hood, ho niggas act funny
Only real niggas really get to touch cash money


I spent 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars, 100 million dollars
And I came from the ghetto (ghetto), and I came from the ghetto (ghetto)

Last night shit was mad real
Scared to go to church
Throw him an iced out cross, then I hit the club
Threw both hands over both my eyes in the court room so I can‰Ûªt see the judge

Now I got the whole house smellin' like smoke
And errythin', coulda smoke a thousand Newports
Really no difference between money and the time
Thin line do it all cause I can't be broke
And nigga there was over right now, you gotta get out here and get it
You a real one you gotta stay strong
Gave my house, my cars, my chain, my fame
Nigga give me my scale and my phone
All I need it 4 zones


Them gossipin' and hatin', just a few determination
I go crazy with that money, I'm a fuckin' mental patient
See I started as a youngin', hustlin' for a club fit
Spend your last fifteen hun', you know that club shit
You fall off, you get back, can't give up, that shit whack
I hear links on my cell, I have blow in my nails
I hear hoes in my jeans, I weigh bees on them beans
They had stamps on them things, I broke bread with my team
Got them birdies in the attic, countin' currency in the basement
Aunty said there's somethin' on her silverware cause she can taste it
And I ain't goin' nowhere, you haters gotta face it
And if I lose it all tomorrow nigga, I just need to basics




[?] ass hustler,yeah I'm tryna post up
Till I can come through in the lamb, with the doors up
Hit it with that HO, then it froze up
Back when they was goin' for the two fo', had it sowed up
They pulled me with this nina  in this strap it be a felony
If I get through with this nina on my lap, I'm livin' heavenly
Speed ballin' like this shit a sprint, but this a marathon
Phone ringin' all day and night, like a telethon
If you a real hustler you gon' get that, he ain't get it
If you a real hustler you know how to stay committed
Between me and you got tired of sleepin' with them roaches
And I been havin' flashback, that's why a nigga focus

So high up in the air, she need a flight to go get it

I get M's like mmm-mmmm-mmm
I'm an asshole, I'm full of myself
You get an asshole full of my foot
They find your ass in the woods when they look
And these hoes ain't as good as they look
I need to take my own advice though, cause if the pussy good then I'm good
Where your ghetto pass nigga, I been big since a little ass nigga
You little ass nigga, you don't get a pass nigga
Started as a middle class nigga
When I blew up, I ain't even hear the blast nigga
I was chillin', smokin' on the loud
Focused on the future, but I need my money now
Don't give me the runaround
Upstairs in my mansion, knock knock, ""who's there?""
I ain't even comin' down if it ain't about the money

No scale but my bitches say I'm boney
Lil mama still blushing at the old me


Nigga Thug in the Impala, whole Hustle Gang follow
Coming from a hundred thousand to another million dollars

Fuck you, fuck him, fuck them
Fuck my ex and her cohorts
Hundred bottles in the club, for no reason
Niggas start trippin boom bow dope fiend
Fendi on my shoes, Fendi on my belt

Don't eat pussy? Bitch, me neither

Same old pipe, just new crack

Then I'm back to my business
Right back to my senses
Every time I'm done wit' it
Pussy callin' my name, nig'
God as my witness, these hoes!




I don't like holes, all my homies locked up sittin' in 'em
I don't like hoes, the whole community put they dick in 'em
They be expecting things, tryna use that pussy power
But that power don't work when you find out it's sour
I don't kiss 'em, that's a no-no, nigga(How was that pussy?)
Kinda loose, it was so-so, nigga

Make a nigga think no one could please me but her
I asked her where to put it, she said ""Skeet it on here""
So I don't need no molly, I'm on E and on her
I prefer the prettiest bodies, go to luxurious lobbies

A bitch gon' be a bitch, a ho gon' be a ho
A killer gon' be a killer - that's something you need to know

A dealer gon' be a dealer, a plug gon' be a plug
My niggas, them my niggas, we just like blood
Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it


I had a young, hot thang fucked my bro and gave 'em brain
And she expect for me to love her, I can never be a lame
I'm attracted to her sexually, but she ain't my main dame
We can be the best of friends, shawty, but you off the chain
See I ain't gonna hold it against ya, I'mma keep it pimping with ya
Don't you come at me with issues, ain't tryna get all in your mixture
I ain't tryna come to get ya,you can meet me somewhere on Peach street
At the W on the Fourteenth, ain't tryna fuck no ho tryna know me
And they wanna fuck my woodie, already smashed the homie
Half of these bitches phony, singing love songs like Toni
Ms. Braxton you the action, stop acting
Just another sad love song waiting to happen




A killer gonna' be a killer,that's regardless of the fact that I'm Tin Man heartless
No love for ya' baby unless you walkin' through my living room braless
With your nipples pokin' through ya wife beater, you the mic eater

Get it meet her,cut to the chase like a cheetah cause she want that Peta
Pipe her down, gon' wipe her clownwhen so many niggas un-wiped her down
You hopin' that she gon' turn her life around, about face, a full one-eighty
A ho into a housewife, that's your lady and me, I never give another but a dope baby
With a good time and a dope dick, she love the way I talk and my flow slick
Ain't no way around it
Yo-yo-yo-yo-your bitch in love with my dick
But big don't love her at all, let a monkey nigga pay the bills while I scrub them jaws
Like a test for DNA, TNA, we the A




Ball so had I need ace of spades, livin' life through these ray bans
Drop four, whipped up eight man
How you do that, got great hands
I ain't seen you niggas like Ray Charles, figure I'll drive these eight car
Trynna' figure how I'ma fuck these eight hoes, same time increase my bank roll
Broke shit had my vision blurred, so I went and copped me a quarter bird
Got me a job got work to do, need a job nig got work for you
Hood lil' niggas die by respect, niggas bleeding what they readin' on the internet
Where ya' from? nigga where ya' plug?
Just like I thought, niggas silent thugs
That is a job fuck niggas hate, why you think I'm carrying this seven-eight
Twenty-two rounds that'll keep me straight, if I ain't got that then I make and bake

Hit your girl with my chains on so that's gold all on her back
Gold all on my watch, so big it's like a clock
Some people wear fox fur, on the Source cover I wore a fox
This for all the DJ's that got this on replay
I sell a brick on eBay, then I celebrate
Several bitches in every state
I'm in Miami with Wayne trying to skate,my family straight
Ayo, ho 'bout to hyperventilate,I owe her one, we did a 68

I'm smoking strong, my nigga, I'm on loud, not Bobby Brown
That's souf side up in here,I spell ""souf"" with a F
F stand for fuck y'all if you ain't fucking with my set
Fuck with me and I'm busting, fuck with me and I'm busting
Every time you see me think about what it would be if I ain't do nothing
Damn right, I'm stunting, damn right, I'm styling
Just got a girl chauffeur and we on a motorcycle and she driving
This Versace, that Versace, this Versace, too
I got killers watching, niggas watching,bitches watching me too
See I'm on lean, on loud, and I got my own lane
You need to mind your own business,it's 2 Chainz and Trinidad (James)

So when she said she's not impressed by paper
Of course I did not believe, no
So I bought clothes and jewelry
Showered her with riches so she'd stay with me, mmm
Only for her to tell me what she really wants is my time quality, mmm
She said


Don't want your money, all I want is you
She said, that bag is pretty, but all I want is you
She said, now don't get me wrong, I love clothes and shoes
But if I had to choose, all I want is you
(She said all I want is you, whoa, whoa, whoa)


I'm an entertainer and I meet a lot of women, that is true
And one thing that I've learn is that women lie a lot better than we do
Than we do, they do
I told myself she's just telling me what I wanna hear I assumed
But every time I substitute, time with money, she would sing this tune, this tune


Don't want your money, all I want is you
She said, that bag is pretty, but all I want is you
She said, now don't get me wrong, I love clothes and shoes
But if I had to choose, all I want is you


Loose it all today, she gonn be here tomorrow
And the day after that
Matter fact, get the rubber band (why)
Cause she know I'm gonna bounce back
She like the life, but she foreign
Bout that life, she just know it
Top down in the coupe, bonnie and clyde
Till the wheels fall off, bonnie gonn ride
Kick back, we just chop it up, she said she on her way, ain't no popping up (nah)
Fine as she wanna be, she got a bindess mind
Bad as she wanna be, she got a bindess crime
Like planning for the future, like to think ahead
Got me planning for my future, thanks to her head
Independent like working for her own
Yeah, so I know it can't be that depressed


Bought you a bag, don't nobody have
Send you on a trip somewhere, though I can't be there with you
Send all that I want babe, let me get you these diamonds brand new shoes
To make up for the fact that I'm not with you
What you say boo, what you say?


Don't want your money, all I want is you

Man toss that lame a stool so he can step it up
Man this soft ass sucka ain't cool bruh, no good luck
You know when they act a fool and when they cut up

But wasn‰Ûªt always, will be
Your pill refill and I‰Ûªll still be
Your addiction, you can touch a prescription, but don‰Ûªt fill me
I let you see my dark side, but like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly, we hit the flight deck and got sprung, pew
Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
But tonight we don't need those pills, just the effects of each other
But we gon' film cause I will want your ex to see

I would never let down my guard
And I hope you feel like dirt when I hoe'd you

But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free and still creep
But these hills see, from that POV
We can touch but the only way you‰Ûªll film me
Is with a camera, feel me?
You‰Ûªre nothing but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I‰Ûªm a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep texting me, but at night, if you seek those thrills
What I expect to be?
Cause if you cheat on him just means I will be the next to be
Your ex, so no complexities, just sex
And don‰Ûªt lecture me, just accept that...

To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?
Yo


His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over - blaow
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy nope, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo,this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him


You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo


The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada,and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dum da-dum dah-dah


You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo


No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Fiveand I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, cause man, these God damn
Food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryna feed and water my seedplus, teeter-totter
Caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby momma drama, screaming on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot,another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point,I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot,or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option - failure's not
Mom, I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go it's my shot, feet: fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got


You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it(For six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
(You are just what the doc ordered)


I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
They said I rap like a robot, so call me  rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his, nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match with this rappity-rap
Packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motha-fuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow?
All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece (yeah)


Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (Pew)
MC's get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac
N.W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C
And induct them into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of (shame)

Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?

So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, lookin' boy
You're witnessing a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say, looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, looking boy
I'ma work for
Everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, looking boy
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable of keeping up
With the same pace, looking boy


Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton No Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm toting
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere
In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I, was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from the Mathers LP 1
When I tried to say
""I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine""
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I wasbut I'm
Morphin' into an immortal
Coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking
Cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya,like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singing to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma,you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop""
Cause I found a, hella way to fuse it
With rock,shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades, these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue-in-cheek,fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
Still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic
To the situation and understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip abroad

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die


I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know somethin's coming
But I'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was
Was it, too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens
Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
Cause here I sit in Lucifer‰Ûªs den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that, I‰Ûªm somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
Cause someone told me that
(Kings never die)


Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blow-out to get me to re-tire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the Renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em, cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say
(It) just goes ta show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under a tack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent up rage, cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be


Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die


I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck you‰Ûªre gonna get Riddick Bowe‰Ûªd
Critics'll end up in critical,think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne
Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, cause


They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold on and prolong these moments
Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over


Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen but Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat cause makin' the beat ain‰Ûªt the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that ""Sound Bombing"" Thirstin' Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'mma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't


Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes

But I believe in the last days
I walk through Hell almost every night
But I believe it's a pathway
Say boy, what you doin' with your life
With those tattoos on your face?
Say boy, you know that you'll pay the price
Well, I guess I'll see when I head that way


To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance
I can almost hear it
My best friend, best friend
When you wish me Hell upon my soul and spirit
Behold these lyrics
I got a best friend, best friend
Yeah, I got a best friend, best friend, yeah


I don't know much about Holy Bibles
But I grew up in the Bible Belt
I put my love for a woman on idle
Because I got beat with my mama's belt
But I learned from my mistakes
Try hard to respect people for what they believing in
But if you spit on my fucking grave
And wish me Hell then I wish you well
I'mma send you straight  up to my best friend


To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit
I hold You nearest
My best friend, best friend
Let the trumpets blow with Your appearance

God, please could you arm me with the armor
To calm me when there's drama like Gandhi?
Could have gone the other  way many times
Could have turned Dalai with the lama
But I squashed my beefs and things seem to be looking decent
Recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter
The priesthood, but at least should
Make an attempt to show some remorse
And to be some sort of a repenter
For the people I've been a menace to
Not a preacher, but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner
Than twine is when I get attacked
So I might say something back that might offend you
So if you don't like when I rap
Or what I have to say on the mic then you
Might wanna act just like quarterbacks
And take a fuckin' hike when I snap cause I'm a sinner
And I (I got a best friend, best friend)
Plus balls and intestines
And they never been yes men
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin' up
The minute I'm ever giving it less than
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it coming
Cause failure's something I can barely stomach
And I only listen to my gut
So unless you're my fuckin' belly button
Don't tell me nothin'
You ain't my (best friend, best friend)
Who you think I'm talking 'bout?
Lifts me up when I'm down and out
Still look to him without a doubt
Still got a (best friend, best friend)
Shout it out like there's never been a louder mouth
Should have never been allowed a mouth
Now that I got a higher power
Now when I blackout, power outage
They powerless, but they crowd around
They tend to flock like shepherds
The black sheep
But I be the worst thing that these motherfuckers ever heard
When I'm counted out
You be D-O-A, they'll announce
But pronounce you dead when they sound it out
So prepare for a rival, your arch enemy surrounds you now
He's all around you
Not even the doctors at the hospital
Are gonna shiggy-shock you back to life
It's im-piggy-possible to revive you
It's word to the diggy doc
Stiggy-stopping is not an option
Something I'm not gonna do
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth
Dawg, I'm the truth like Biggie rockin' with 2Pac in a suit
Talking to Proof dropping a deuce
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable script, cock it and shoot
And who you think's my Glock that I use?
That I pull from to get my strength up against these haters
And he'll be waiting at the gate when you get sprayed up
Sending you hoes straight up to deal with my (best friend)


To the Father, Son and Holy Spirit

Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf,gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb,I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...

Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat

And I want you to say that

Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself
You‰Ûªre floating freely, no emotion


Got a fuckin‰Ûª mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
You're a legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Manage to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed

Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothing, I made something doing
What I do, through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point-of-view
The renegade, you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture, bring em a lot closer to the block where they
Pop toastersand they live with they Moms
Got dropped roadsters from botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No he's not around
Now how that sound to ya, jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without riding round
Hiding down ducking strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you're worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt


Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with em a minute
Cause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't,then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Using his music to steer it, sharing his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference: they're saying you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment, nah nah
That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fucking do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here
I don't think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo

What's on my mind at any given time of day
Cause I'm a renegade,never been afraid to holler
About anything (etc.)


I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lot of innocent lives lost on the project bench
Whatchu hollering, gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega,iron under my coat, feeling braver
Durag wrapping my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan my pops left me,and often, my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me I wasn't grown,especially on nights
I brought something home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor, thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raising green up
Raising my fingers to critics
Raising my head to the sky B.I.G. I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight


See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the King of these Latter-Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
As a monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape
Media scapegoat; who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie
While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons,take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do,I'm just a kid from the gutter
Making this butter off these bloodsuckers

Game over!",rap,,,,Eminem,25 To Life prod. by Danny Keyz & DJ Khalil,http://genius.com/Eminem-25-to-life-lyrics,"
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life


I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life
I woulda laid down and died for you, I no longer cry for you
No more pain,bitch, you took me for granted, took my heart and ran it
Straight into the planet, into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it:I'mma take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'mma be the boss of you now, goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fucking get repaid?
Look at how I dress: fucking baggy sweats,go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase, it's time to fucking step
And I won't be coming back, so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fucking left,I laughed while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept,it's unfortunate but it's




I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half
'til I snap,don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so, do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you still, man
I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you: go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat, I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out,I fell for this so many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this,I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama,I'm drawn to shit
I guess I'm a mess,cursed and blessed
But this time I ain't changing my mind, I'm climbing out this abyss
You're screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you, hip hop, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served, bitch and it's just...

",rap,,,,Eminem,313 (Ft. Eye-Kyu) prod. by Jeff Bass & Mr. Porter,http://genius.com/Eminem-313-lyrics,"Now what you know about a sweet MC,from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see


Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick acapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forget a gold digger's succubus; my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke,can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent's my temperament
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impotent
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nymphomaniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate,yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blast your hate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Buckin' these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leavin' them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up
Well I'mma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your ownwith the strength of Lou Ferrigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know




So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will will be sealed your casket closed you still will be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jeru jackin' off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I shout with a slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with ease
Dethrone MC's and I'mma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow followers' singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands
If they swallowed their fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack

Tired of all be blending, and ending up dating sluts

Gold digging bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fitting, girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear, spitting like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't comb it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we donewe stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the ho now
At every industry party, getting so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Trying to roll up on Miami, leaving with a broke neck
Oh shit, lethal lyric equal land mind
I be stacking up white rappers like I'm throwing gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposing the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fucking shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jamming like three up in the chamber

""I just wanna figure something in my head
And maybe you can help me out here
When a person is insane, as you clearly are
Do you know that you're insane?
And you're just sitting around reading Guns &amp; Ammo
Masturbating in your own feces
Do you just stop and go
""Wow, it's just amazing how fucking crazy I really am""?""


Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Came late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last O' that I sniffed of 'caine
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 bursting
You getting spun backwards like every word of obscene cursing
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stopping your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'mma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out

Goodnight, goodbye


You're walking down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the morning and you're in a, nightmare it's horrible
Right there's the coroner, waiting for ya
To turn the corner so he can corner ya, you're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of hiscornea,he just saw ya run
All ya want is to rest cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again,swallowing a Klonopin
While I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn,holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom and
Make sure I got all of it,wake up naked at McDonald'swith
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must'a just blacked out again,not again


It's 3 a.m. in the morning,put my key in the door
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must'a killed 'em, killed 'em


Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's onthe tube,maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I findHannah Montana
Then I reach for the aloe and Lanolin
Bust all over the wall panelin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantle and
Grab my flannel and my bandana thenkiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causing illusions again,brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors and pins
Jesus, when does it end?
Phases that I go through, dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know whogave these molecules to
Me,what am I gon' do? Hey,the prodigal son
The diabolical one,very methodical when I slaughter them




She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again


I cut and I slash, slice and gash
Last night was a blast, I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half pint ofthe Jack
My last Vic and a half,a fleshlight ofKim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was: I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights, pushed him into the stinkin' tub
Cut him up into pieces and just when I went to drink his blood
I thought I oughta drink his bath water, that oughta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me;that might be an artery, son
Your bloodcurdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man, there's gotta be one
Oh no, there's probably none,he can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs, but ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up

For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (here)
Two dudes ran up and jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast, it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
He came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming ""GET HIM!""
I grabbed one,  lit him on fire, pinned, and bit him

He still loves me cause he puts me in his ink
He does, doesn't he, still is, isn't he?
Nah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart cause he misses me
I can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky
And is no risk of disease cause he ain't with anyone is he?
This bitch really thinks she can get me
If she still wants me, driving across country
Strapped up to the front seat, missing all her front teeth
Thinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me?
I told this cunt she's gonna over-do it once
And once she does, she was stuffed up in a trunk
Crunch,he scrunched her up in a ball
Bunched up nice and comfy

AndI just bought her a truck for 50,000 dollars
Accused me of doing drugs and scream 'n holla""
Then I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana
And all I know is every time I go
To them hiding spots,wherever she hides herblow
The little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke
That's growing smaller,and that was just a while ago
And I wouldn't even let on like I know
What was I supposed to do, call her out on it,we just argue

That's ""Chupacabra"", suck the life out of you
There won't be enough of your brain left to fill a teaspoon
We two vanishing men that makes the bad things blend
And probably go platinum on the day that the world ends

""Rhymes that you never even heard before...""


When it comes to beef
I gets relief when I kill and breathe
Send a wreathe get your family ready for the grief
I'll knock ya teeth
Take ya seat like a thief
Make you change your beliefs
Burn a leaf before you go beneath
Rappers, I kill 'em
Down to Hell is where I send 'em
Feelin' my pen is illin so much
I need some penicillin
Jams I'm spillin cause I'm bound here
Kicking shit that's solitaire
Your crown is RIP cause rapper you sound counterfeit
You get a round of clips
If you play hard
You stay scarred
Thinkin you're brave ya'll
You're in a graveyard
One in a mil' son
I'm ill when it comes to skills
Wanna get killed or catch a dum-dum in your grill
Rappers diminishin, in scrimmage
I'm good to the finish
I'll speak in English while your brothers are speakin in gibberish
You touch the mic and I'm out to bury your fingers
You want some fame? I'll beat you up in front of Jerry Springer
So pay the price, say they nice
When they play the dice
I'll take you life, slay you twice
Before you break your rights


Cats who rap are feminine
I'm sendin this without the benefits of cinema scents of cinnamon
So submit it in your mental
Since you find it essential to stencil simple sentences
A sentence is simple
You banned from usin writin utensils
Whether crayon, pen or pencil
Observe verse packed with syntax
That causes skin cracks on impact
Send them wack men back to the lab
Where most of them laugh
I can hand you a manual to make what I plan to do more tangible
You still wouldn't understand the full concept
It slips through your fingers like sand granules
Scan the land and the blue sea annually
And you will see
Which animals eat amphibians from spittin up that written stuff
It‰Ûªs all the same
It‰Ûªs the reason for cyphers prematurely spittin' up
Ironic phonics show my flow is far from ambionic
To be honest no hits of chronic in mi bionic
I'm beyond it
The texture of my lecture is complex like a professor
Skeptics greet me exceptional when I bless sound receptacles
Much stretchin through my vestibules
Turns crews to vegetables
They grab my testicles and cup em
Fuck em, bless em through, what",rap,,,,Eminem,6 in the Morning by D12,http://genius.com/D12-6-in-the-morning-lyrics,"Good morning!
Wake your motherfucking asses up!
Y'all with us or what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my group, BITCH!


For whatever it's worth, it's worth me having my ass whipped
Cause I'mma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with
I just can't get passed these little pissants
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it, cause we can and they can't spit
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens and I snap then it's a wrap
Then it's a scrap and it isn't rap, is it?
Hip-hop isn't a sport anymore
When you gotta go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but my passion
Is to smash anyone rapping without having to slap him
Believe me, I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol
When I'm pissed now, but it all depends on just how
Far it gets took on the mic
Cause I'm telling you right now you're not gonna like it
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pulling you with me
You poke a stick at a pitbull, you get bit, B
Your words stick to you like crazy glue when you diss me
Cause they just bounce off me, like bullets do 50
I'm the beautiful-est thing, and you're gonna miss me
When I'm gone, like Keith Murray when he threw his stool
And hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy and Proof- are you with me?


Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers,come on IN
Cause we get it on and, 'til the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning


They consider me the epitome of a beef starter
In the party with heat, it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck snubs,I walk in clubs with a shotgun
Constantlypopping slugs, they hot son, better not run (AHH!)
The bosses of all bosses;a holocaust to whoever ain't cautious
In a house full of dog shit
I'm a Gothic death prophet, you'll stop breathing
You'll die quicker than mach speed without bleeding
It ain't about what you reading
When you meet me better speak like it's Seasons Greetings
Either that or we'll be beefing frequent
You niggas need an E just to speak shit
In your window there's a petite bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I'll snipe you with it andwon't even keep it a secret
Nigga, I did it from the mind of a mental patient
When Glocks sway you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?




I heard you niggas don't like us but so what,this beef is like what the fuck
Did he say in his rap?Em, I can see that he just a punk
I mean these niggas'll squeeze on me pleased when seeing guts
I don‰Ûªt need no enemies, just my family, a couple trucks
And my MPC and a mic, they empty out on them bike
To fight you in front of everyone important that I don't like
No need for metaphors to get points across when I write
This emotion's enough to say, ""Fuck you bitch and I don't like you!""
WHAT! I might as well give this up, but that'd be selfish as fuck
You'll leave D12 in this, but we can't self-destruct
I've never felt it this much, c'mon fellas get up!
We gotta fight like Bugz last night of his life, C'MON!


I walk with a limp, pistol hanging off of the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split, even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out, shooting atG's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze, I can't believe
You speaking on moving keys,but every time we hear you kick it
The only thing that you selling is woof tickets
I look wicked cause niggas'll test your nutsack
So when they bust you better bust back orget your guts clapped
Outta your stomach, and when they want it
I'll bring a hundred niggas from Runyon so get to gunnin if you coming

",rap,,,,Eminem,8 Mile,http://genius.com/Eminem-8-mile-lyrics,"Sometimes I just feel like, quittin' I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white,sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da,it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up {*wham*} I just slam shut
I just can't do it,my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just beenvicked
So I must then get, off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit; yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road


I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road


I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap,gotta moveASAP
And get a new plan,momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step,don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' you God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin' you dawg I'mbailin'this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'mma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own,I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road




You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance,a certificate
Of authenticity,you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned,havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show, to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin' to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in thisbattlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one,the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot,sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin I just blow,my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third
I am no longer scared now,I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

And Clarence parents have a real good marriage

Dick hard like Rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo


The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I‰Ûªm just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people‰Ûªs champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won‰Ûªt mention my ten thousand hours in training
While juggling gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin‰Ûª out before we even get a chance to miss ‰Û÷em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it‰Ûªs both and I got large amounts of it, it‰Ûªs real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y‰Ûªall incapable
To be the God emcees,you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I‰Ûªm rollin‰Ûª deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We had to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that‰Ûªs how it played nowadays
It‰Ûªs like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It‰Ûªs seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays,I'm talking
Hiiigher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I‰Ûªm the one
This is vintage from nineteen-ninety-somethin'
I‰Ûªm the son of the pioneer that got you niggas on
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I‰Ûªm yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I‰Ûªm in the White House going all out
Bumping, God-bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I‰Ûªm David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let‰Ûªs go there, my DNA is DMT, I‰Ûªm so rare
My juvenile was wilder than the NOLA
A locomotive couldn‰Ûªt track me down in my career
Runnin‰Ûª this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deploy him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain‰Ûªt for him
Probably thinking it‰Ûªs for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I‰Ûªm snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin‰Ûª
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it‰Ûªs important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
I tell a bitch don‰Ûªt sweat me (Don't sweat me)
I kill this whole fuckin‰Ûª beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
Ib should‰Ûªve never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y‰Ûªall gon‰Ûª die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don‰Ûªt make me do demonstrations
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I‰Ûªm sorry y‰Ûªall not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I‰Ûªm not to play with

They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear


""YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!""


""Man down, where you from, nigga?""
""Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?""
""Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?""
""This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga""


Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans,hope euphoria can slow dance
With society,the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine,Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine,we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch,a wall of bullets coming from
AK's, AR's,""Aye y'all, duck""
That's what momma said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess,m.A.A.d city


""Man down, where you from, nigga?""
""Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?""

Wake your punk ass up! It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. Real simple and plain, I'mma teach you some lessons about the street. It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. How we do


Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend,we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick A.K.A. Compton's human sacrifice


G-yeah, cocaine, weed.Niggas been mixing shit since the 80's, loc.Sherm sticks,butt nakeds.Dip, make a nigga flip.Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit.One time's crooked and shit.Block a nigga in.Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton


I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of I.V.s with the fucking spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grands where a mothafucka stand


If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketballand some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor,instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage,kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn,they vandalizing
The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive,hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye,listen coward, the concept is aim
And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head,the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A.made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what

Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask,backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular,that was my problem
I was in a dark room,loud tunes,looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up,fillin' up my cup,I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minuteand the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me:

All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me,making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough

I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same



If these walls could talk (x6)
Sex


She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, With you, With you
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls say hey, say hey
Everyone deserves a night to play
And she plays only when you tell her no

[Hook:Anna Wise,ThundercatandBilal]
If these walls could talk
(I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk
(I love it when I‰Ûªm in it, I love it when I‰Ûªm in it)


If these walls could talk they‰Ûªd tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I‰Ûªm not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I‰Ûªm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated, every nook and cranny
I mean it's still amazing before they couldn‰Ûªt stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I‰Ûªm here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around demolition might crush


If these walls could talk
(I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk
(I love it when I‰Ûªm in it, I love it when I‰Ûªm in it)


If these walls could talk they‰Ûªd tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously,I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that‰Ûªs my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don‰Ûªt know how long I can wait in these walls
I‰Ûªve been on these streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must‰Ûªve missed them
I‰Ûªm not involved, I‰Ûªd rather diss them
I‰Ûªd rather call on you, put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon‰Ûª crush


If these walls could talk
(I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk
(I love it when I‰Ûªm in it, I love it when I‰Ûªm in it)




If your walls could talk, they‰Ûªd tell you it‰Ûªs too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper
Walls could talk


I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression

You rollin‰Ûª with lames, we ain't rolling the same
I‰Ûªm the best out in this muthafucker
If I could get a cheque out of this muthafucka
Big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this muthafucka with no regrets
If you ain't living your life for your kids
I ain't giving yo ass no respect
Sean I love you my nigga, I‰Ûªm out




I gotta break your fucking heart
I gotta climb these fucking charts
I gotta do something that‰Ûªs innovative
Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tia‰Ûªs momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty of Carne Asada
I gotta find me a wife to elope
I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
But those who lied to the minority will make em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth
Need to know every detail about this Earth
The devil controls it
So before you scrutinize how I feel
Ask God if them polls important

Don't let love die, you regroovin' yourself

I'll make that shirt say RIP,I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place,give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters,dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta,I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff


Barely even conscious,talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real


When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in,my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians,new beginning again
You in school at 10, late,Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up,wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot,Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf


Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous,aw shit, no off switch
Lawless,obnoxious, on that ""suck my cock"" shit
That is my synopsis,ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless,heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?


Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon‰Ûªs reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin',drinking Hennylike I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I‰Ûªve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I‰Ûªm a free man, try not to eat ham


Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can‰Ûªt pronounce, like, ‰ÛÏHow you ask for that?‰Û
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron,open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I‰Ûªve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label,I‰Ûªm taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch,I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I waschoppin' blade
Grippin‰Ûª grain, fuckin' hoes,candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you‰Ûªll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample nigga!)
Muddy water flow,Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag,popping benji tags on your wifey‰Ûªs ass
That‰Ûªs out of line, but in living color?
I‰Ûªm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist",rap,,,,Kendrick Lamar,2013 Yeezus Tour Dates by Kanye West,http://genius.com/Kanye-west-2013-yeezus-tour-dates-lyrics,"October 19 2013Key Arena*#

# WITH KENDRICK LAMAR
^ SPECIAL GUEST TO BE ANNOUNCED
TICKETS WITH* ON SALE FRIDAY 9 13 13",rap,,,,Kendrick Lamar,25 by Punch,http://genius.com/Punch-25-lyrics,"They felt like they were laying tracks, for the generation to come. I think my mother knew that freedom wouldn't come in her lifetime, just like I know it won't come in mine. It's a matter of, either we stay like this or somebody sacrifice, somebody laying tracks, so we can stay in a 360 degree. Deadly circle, somebody used to break out and risk, you know losing everything and being poor and getting deep down. Cause someone has to do something, had I had a father, had I had some of these opportunities. I would be able to handle my mother more


I was taught never trust a nigga, far as you can see him
Teach a nigga how to fish, as apposed to try'na feed him
Look a man in the eyes, that's the best way to read him
Cause faces they change, but point of views remain
I got a strange feeling, that I'm a lil bit different
Beyond the customs and tradition of a project living
My Korean war vet, grandfather's affliction
Was stress and I inherited his heart condition
And Van Arthur's addiction, was heroin needles
Petty hustling, d'evils, that street men lust
So I'm mixed with that lethal combination but trust
I've only scratched the surface, what's underneath this verse is
The feeling of a young boy lost, without a purpose
Still waters run deep in the street we were submerged in
Police lurking, try'na catch a nigga serving
He ain't going back to jail, so he bust a verse


This is for my everyday young nigga
It don't really matter where you from niggas
Before you leave the house, kiss your moms nigga
Cause you don't know when that day'll come nigga
Cause only Lord knows that I know how you feel
What we gotta do just to live
Is try not to get our cap peeled, try not to get your cap peeled


It's hard to get to know me, unless you hear between bars
Tortured soul self contained on my childhood scars
I was involved from a far, affected by the street laws
Concrete walls, not even earthquakes could shake them brick walls
Nickerson garden projects this is me y'all
Where Dope dealers have it all and then freefall
Caine numbs the pain up and down the ghetto seesaw
The voice of the youth, they hear me and they see y'all
They don't see a diamond in the rough, they see flaws
They should see how we was raised and they would be in awe
Against all it gets hard not to kill niggas
It's like a full-time job not to grab the semi-auti
And go kamikaze on somebody who plotting
Probably on my body laying lifeless, ungodly sacrifices
To the streets, this is the trinity
Money malice and murder the hood's deity




They say the average black man only lives to 25
Well I made it past that and a nigga still alive
Which means I'm in the red, I'm indebted to death
That's the wages that sin pay, I'm still tracing my steps
Leaving my footprints in the sand, the concrete rose
That grew on infertile land and blossomed to a grown man
My only fear is pops holding moms hand
Dripping tears on my casket, I refuse to let it happen
By any means avoiding the city traffic
Shooters got the green light, they blocking your right of passage
A young kid turned savage, city madness
A picture painted on the street's canvas, excuse my brashness
I'm trying to live to see past this
Staring at the world and my rear view past tense
In no particular fashion, I'm on borrowed time I'mma grind with a passion




Generation to generation to come
They won't come in mind
Sacrifices, sacrifices, sacrifices
Deadly circle, deadly circle",rap,,,,Kendrick Lamar,2DopeBoyz Freestyle,http://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-2dopeboyz-freestyle-lyrics,"Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Your seats,we going to Cloud 9 and we
Coming back in a week,and the weak good
Riddance,only the strong permitted to ride
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi,one of a
Kind like great antiques museumsbuy
Haters I tell em hi, enemies I don't tell em shit
But booya click booya click, click


Ooh, ya'll done stumbled on a fortune
The rebirth of hip hop since they got abortions
And I rock like Mt. Rushmore,grab your thesaurus
So you can find a synonym of a nigga that been gem
Diamond in the rough
Sheriffs wanna see me cuffed like the links of a button up
Book em down! Fuck is up?
Mind of a Vietnam Vet when a nigga rhyme
A nigga shine, like I'm seeing signs in a different light
I'm on my grind, see it right? Real starving artist
Finna blow like a Mario Game cartridge,standing on my own two
Me and Dave like Big and Puff before shiny suits
Welcome to the Compton Zoo, lying with a lion on Rosecrans Avenue
A tiger on Central
Arms so soar beating up these instrumentals Sounwave give me
More, after that find a morgue with a mortice, because we..




Ooh, and I'm back up on my bullshit,shooting to the top with a hollow
Tip full clip
Analogy is like a pit bull on the pulpit, I drool I don't really
Spit, mad dog in this bitch,foaming at the mouth, is you a man or a mouse?
Sipping Mickey's, while you looking like Mickey trapping it out
That's not a diss, that's really a dope line,and in order to see my vision you
Probably would go blind
I'm chilling with a blonde, she dumb as fuck, but she can suck a bowling ball
Through a straw, that make you tell your mom
I'm just a little nigga trying to make my city proud, I used to watch Doug andwear
My cousins hand-me-downs
Now I'm grown up, unemployed,sipping Henny, pissing throuh a cup, and still get
The job done, 2DopeBoyz I said what up, tell your listeners to have some frost
Bitten gloves cause

",rap,,,,Kendrick Lamar,2Nite by Dr. Dre  (Ft. Jeremih),http://genius.com/Dr-dre-2nite-lyrics,"Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)


Yeah, she got that shit that make you kill a nigga
Crack that last bottle, I'll kill it with you
Pour my feelings out and spill it with you
That's a no-no,but what he don't know
Never hurt him, so just desert him
I find it hard to believe that he ain't pullin' your weave
No, I'm kiddin', I'm knowin' my dick is different
He kept his distance, I kept comin' over and stayed persistent
You bitin' your lips, toes twitching and she crinching
Steamin' up the bathroom 'til we left it a sauna
I beat it up and now you usin' my tee as pajamas
Your friends tried to warn you about me, even your mama
But you said you'd deal with the consequence, even if it was karma
But how can I complain when you give me insane brain?
Like you graduated with honors, you probably hate that I'm honest
But, fuck it, I'm going all out
You should too, good things don't last forever, I thought you knew


Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)


Now don't you no worry about that
Whatever you want, I'm on that
So don't hesitate, girl, when you lonely
Baby, don't worry, we know that I got you


Now here we go again, from the bed to the floor again
I hear your phone on vibrate and I know it's him
But that's what happens when that kitty's in the lion's den
You start lying and changing places
You might've been, I might've been too aggressive
But it was far from desperate
I mean, the swag I got, just know it's half the effort
They tryin' to toot my horn
But, shit, I sworn that I swarmed up in it, stamped and fingerprint it
Left the coupe tinted when you played the passenger
Don't be passing up 'til we finish
What we started, you with it? I'm with it
Then lay your seat way back like it was vintage
While I hit the highway and slowly puff on this spinach
Camouflage emotions got your feelings wide open
I'm hoping you come to grips
At least before you provoke 'em to trip
But that's inevitable, and if I put you on a pedestal
That means I'm fuckin' you on a chair


Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love
(Fucking like we in love, we be fucking like we in love)


Now don't you no worry about that
Whatever you want, I'm on that
So don't hesitate, girl, when you lonely
Baby, don't worry, we know that I got you


Now that I got you about they thinking out you
I want to stop and I don't want you to stop that
Ow, we in a phase, oh, I can't wait
Cause waters don't label you, oh, no, no
I'm from, came from the bottom, so just get on top of that
How about with the top back with your top back?
Take that off, uh, ooh, ooh, break that off more, more


Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)
We're gonna take our time
Not tomorrow, no, tonight, we'll love

Pocket full of dubs
Homies outta line
Clip full of slugs
Baby here's my number
If you tryna fuck, baby do your thang
Shake shake it up
Sick of watts you claim, Come and give it up
Baby I'm a player, Go and hit me up
Baby do your thang
Shake shake it up, shake shake it up, shake shake it up


You should already know what I came for
Once the neon light hit thetop dog logo
See my, chain hang out
See my, wrists hang out
See my, homies hang out
They, gang bang out
West coast my state, left coast my state, you state myspace, internet gangster
You know my name baby girl no stranger
Blue Bell jeanson low cut taper
No I can't save ya
Name that captain
[?] when I'm in the Aston, Martin
So awkward when I park it
Rev up your engines, sound like it farting
I'm in the club sitting with some foreign
She don't speak English words sound retarded
We go hard in that project apartment
Five minutes in Watts, get it started




Sit back relax I'mma give you a walk through, through the city of Watts, throughthe city of God
Where them bitches shaking that ass,deuce deuce in they bras
Where them niggas rocking that [?] that's hard
Where they keep the Glock in their pants, chopper's right in the car
And if you step up on the daily's you might leave with a scar
If your gang tight might leave with a broad and like two of her friends might enjoy a mÌ©nage
And that's night life, in Watts California
Parties ain't over till like six in the morning
This Hennessey's straight, gotta nigga zoning out
Take another swig then I'm rolling out
If you ain't banging better hold your mouth
Don't claim nothing that you know you're not
So just chill, grab your bitch because life's too short
Just stick to the script

",rap,,,,Kendrick Lamar,6'7 (Ft. ScHoolboy Q),http://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-67-lyrics,"Said I'm a fuckin' monster
A massive attack I haunt ya
Mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors
Mastered that after that I went for thermometors
Popped 'em all,then popped in the jaw of Tracy Veronica
Holla back they promised us
No pajamas insomnia
Will attack, I attack like piranha does
Hit your block like a comet (BLAHH!)
And you all know what time it is
2012, mark your calendarscalisthenics and silencers exercisin' that trigger strap
Rock with us Metallica, competition no talented
I'm in a jungle what's wild enough
Just might stumble upon a pack of lions
No lyin' my soldiers dyin' this is Iraq
Alliances lining with stars and bars of a prison rep
My science applyin' pressureher stretcher is neededpay the proceeds
Or your livin' debty'all soft as a giga-pet
You niggas can't see me unless you watchin' the TV or ultra huggin' my silhouette
My flow got the ceiling wet
I spit 'til I feel my breath
Who sinkin' my fuckin' chest
She fuckin' the fuckin' best
Mean my dick is the dick of death
Means I'm killin that pussy
Like Spike whenever that Jerry slept


Yeah Dre
Me and Andre the Giant, 6'7 and climbin'
Whether you storm to your climate
Whether your beat makin' or rhyming
Bumpin some Phyllis Hyman
Hand full of diamonds like Jay fans
On a island with Ray Bans
Glasses palmin' asses that probably came wit a great tan(laughs)
I be the motherfuckin' mecca of these hub city spectrum
Where they at I will dissect them like a fucking frog rectum
Why you wreckin' with irreputable my worst flow incredible
They probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Etcetera etcetera Bentley passin up Celicas
They tellin' us about shit, HiiiPoWeR in your mouth, bitch
And Top Dawg can vouch bitch
Nigga what you 'bout,about face with army outfits
The generals here
That mean the hustlers and the criminals here
Penitence reachin' pinnacles of life and despair and me I solemnly swear tohandle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never askin' Allah for it
Only difference is I be spazzin' and still a proud poet
Put me in a category
I don't know what's a sadder story
Guts and glory
Your pain bore me you ain't really lived it
I take you to a block where they Crippin
Or Piru that 5'2 gun bigger than the torso of Pippen
Bitch I been doin' before you niggas ruined it
Show me somethin' different
You either kissin' dick or givin' me distance
You live in a district of dimebags and dummies I know your statistics
Who your boss, he more like my assistant
Get lost have a egg and a biscuit
Break fast when we aimin' them biscuits
Pay cash when your chain come up missin'
Q...Q


Double up, shit, what the fuck?
Get me some my promo poppin'
Setbacks droppin'
Soon they watchin'
I just lock and load explode
Target flowed I'm somewhere blowed
Marriotts and Swisher Sweets
LA nigga prolly east
Cheerin' for the ragin' beats
X O henny scrape the keif
Bangin C I'm bangin' B
Put them niggas next to me
Stop and focus get the lead
I'm here now let the hardest speak
Ya all them dudes got ovaries, period
Run on sentence still I'm ventin'
Air conditionin' coolest breeze
Ill diseases
Grip my penis, shoot my semen
Still I'm comin', miles a runnin'
I was learnin' getting knowledge
Head is throbbin', she's a goblin
We be mobbin' over bitches
Stick and miss and she the business
Get a witness pussy frenchin
Yes, a mission
Poppin' off like a mission
Proposition, gettin' money
Drop a nigga, rush a nigga
Stomp a nigga, crush a nigga
Dust a nigga, copperhead gon' thrust a nigga
Heatin' up the winnnin nigga
Somethin' to remember nigga
Hella sick, I got a spit
Curse with a verse like God told me to kill the shit
Load the clip Heckler &amp; Koch

Bada bing by the ding a ling
Natural hoover
Fing ring with a vision clearin' it with Visine

I crush A1 hoes (true)
Rock A1 clothes (true)
Drive A1 whips (true)
And still pour A1 sauce on my shit
I come from the bottom


Crushing all these hoes,rocking all this ice
Selling all these O's,nigga, I done did that twice
So I'm just riding round in my Rolls,about to get on my bike
Just to touchdown in my hood and I put that on my life
I'm like yeah nigga, I'm there nigga,I ball hard all year, nigga
My diamonds all clear nigga, smack my chain you dead nigga
I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what you thought
But all my dogs they murk, and all my dogs go hard, fuck that
My new young chick look exactly like Rihanna
Ass like Nicki, but she yellow like Madonna
I take her to the mall,buy her all types of designers
YSL, fly Chanel, all that Dolce &amp; Gabbana
I jump right back like 36,lean hard when I turn the whip
If I ain't have my rap deal, then I still be serving bricks
So I kill a pussy, I murder shit, homicide on shorty
My gold Role cost 60 racks, my rose gold cost 40


I get A1 money, I'm an A1 nigga
Got a A1 swagger, I'm getting A1 bitches
I just bought me a Rollie, you can skate on nigga
If they don't love it, they hate it, well get your hate on nigga
Cuz I got A1 everything, A1 everything
A1 everything, I get A1 everything
I got A1 credit, A1 hoes
I drive A1 whips, and I rock A1 clothes


Pray to God, I washed my hand but I be damned
2012, 100 racks to Uncle Sam
A 24 year old millionaire
Don't read the contract 'less a mill in there
A1 credit,park my car bowlegged
I got a bus full of bitches, I call it Jerome Bettis
I grab my dick in the picture, your ho be cropping the image
I let you scrape off the dishes, we eating nigga,I'll finish it
Then come right back,hope you insomniac
Sleep on me if you wanna take a dirt nap
Bitch I'm talking ca-ca-ca-ca then more ca-ca-ca-ca
Hit your roof until I pop your top up
Then more ca-ca-ca-ca, til I know I gotcha
Ballin like I'm baldin', then I see Jordan in the mirror
Nigga that's flawless VVS,CC text me what you wearing
Puttin my all inside your bitch, I grip her hips thats power steering
About to hydroplane when I board that plane and land inside the building

",rap,,,,Kendrick Lamar,Ab-Soul's Outro (Ft. Ab-Soul) prod. by Terrace Martin,http://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-ab-souls-outro-lyrics,"What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
Fire in the street, fire in my swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your little sister
Just get a sip of this elixir,before they crop us out of the picture
I've never seen a crop circle but I've seen a cop circled the block
I puff squares, but I swear one day I'mma stop my nerves itch
On the brink of my career, while my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams (Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me)
One two, three four grams and a fifth of Hennessey
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary


Section 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan, we raising hell


Lord forbid, the homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin, you vote for the better man
Come to our show you can see the diversity
Unify people they going to peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we going to manipulate it, I hope you participating
Ayo Dot,won't you let these cats know
We knew we'd be here, like back in 04'
Started HiiiPower because our generation
Needed a generator and a system, meant to disintegrate us
And all we do is assist them
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture hasn't developed yet
Like what if Keisha were celibate
What if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like children
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend with his girlfriend's girlfriend
Let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well (Odd Future's aight)
But our future is not,that Martial law shit dropped, we gonna all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat that fast food, and use that flouride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public
Work a little nine to five, don't forget to pay yourtithes
And to thank God you're alive (HiiiPower)
And on another note, we focused like the Hubble Telescope, Soul


Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam


I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie, I do, Section 80
Your son will play me if the radio won't
Daughters that just turn one to twenty one listen to Kendrick
For instance


What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV


True story, hmm, can you repeat that for me Soul


What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
Is you gonna plead the fifth, or sound the horn
The time is now my child, come on


See a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes
God and history all in the same sentence
You know what all the things have in common
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I've spent twenty three years on the earth searching for answers
'til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in, I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You've ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes
God and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star,I'm not the next socially aware rapper

I watch this fire that we‰Ûªre gathered around

A generation of bliss and disobedience
Know they can't control us
Know they can't control you
Know they can't control us
But we can control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight, you will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing that you represent something thats bigger than all of us
Our family
Heart, honor and respect
This is you, this is me

Watts City finest, and the Hub City threat
LB I see you my nigga
Let's go


I'm trying to get cash, quick fast
In the back she's a [?]
With past of Trinidad
[?] plenty hash up in the stash
When you got gangsta black [?] up in the back room
When I walk back, more vicious than wildcats
I would have swallowed that
Nickerson Garden projects gain the profit
Of my lyrical content
Build a monument
Gotta put a clip to your conscience
Watch this, pull up on your block in a stick-shift
Pop six, watch you fall just from the fifth hit
The spliff lit, when I'm high can't I spit sick
First round, number one draft on [?] shit
Got the mind of a chief, the heart of a soldier
With a rifle got a hell of a range like rover
And the fight, got a hell of a strike like vipers
When the gat, got a hell of a aim like snipers


You wanna act tough
Let's see if you really are, when this gun busts
Oh you say you want war, nigga let's go
Bring the drama, that's on my momma
You don't wanna rumble
Jay Rock I'll put you under
(You wanna act tough
Let me see if you really hard, when this gun busts
Oh you say you want war, nigga let's go
Bring the drama, that's on my momma
You don't wanna rumble
K. Dot will put you under)


Since VapoRubs mom's got my Nyquizzle
I was just a scrub now it's all about the bizzles
Trying to make a buck slinging weed and E pizzles
My nigga hit me up, and as far the stizzle
I'll eat your ass up show you how a bullet fizzle
Get your ass touched one hand on your whizzle
The other on the clutch,my middle finger up
Shit I'm not giving a fuck
Catch me on Rosecrans and Central leanin' like I'm supposed to
My brain is mental a nigga stay focused
Plus I'm in the hood with the hood rats and roaches
Caught crack, and served athree-fifth on my culture
Desert Eagle on me these niggas acting like vultures
I ain't dying homie I swear that your thoughts is bogus
Keep the iron on me I'll crease you flat if you approach us
Acting how you act you gone get some out of that holster




I'm a Watts living soldier nigga
I ain't running, I'ma stand my ground
I'ma keep on gunning
My momma never raised a punk, nigga I ain't a chump
You disrespect you'll be on my thump
Ghetto kill, make you lift up
You don't wanna get struck
Like a match, got a back
That'll break a shit bruh
I attack with a Mac, that'll tear your shit up
Now the paramedics gotta come and make that pick up
Dog, I hit your block in a pick-up
Jay Rock I'm me, a lion, a man, a [?]
I do it by myself, with a hook and an uppercut
Doctor got a stitch you up
Nigga are you real or what
I'm a little guy but I'm tough
I hit hard then I'm natural
You a dead man when my gat bust
If you running nigga better run a little faster
These bullets likeHeinz oh yeah they'll catch ya

Twelve bottles in the case,nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight,nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerancewhen your age don't exist


Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
I hope that take the pain away from the feelin' that he felt today
You know, when you part of Section 8
And you feel like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with a 808 (A melody and some hoes)
Playstation and some drank(Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black
She black too, purple label on her back,but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D




Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa

Like no one else in this apartment
""Beg your pardon?""""Oh, I rap baby""
""How old are you?"",She say, ""Twenty-two""
I say, ""Twenty-three"",""Okay, then we are crack babies""
""Damn, why you say that?"" She said, ""Where my drink at?""
""I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors that the police relaxed""
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen; Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside
Then she said, ""Read between the lines""
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the Nuvo start to drown
Her body and I know the both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me, then looked at it
Then she grabbed it,then she said, ""Get it understood""
You know why we crack babies?
Because we born in the '80s,that A.D.H.D. crazy""

Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?
You're unfamiliar but still I feel ya
Energy sending me towards the ceiling
I'm high now, are you up there?
If you was, I would climb every other stair
I gotta stare, I mean wow
And I'm wowed, no one compares
You must have won, you must have won
Every pageant in America when you was young


Lips, hips, hair drips down her back

The only girl that can make time
Then make me, stop...




So now we on, so now we going
Living in the city of the unknown
I show her off, I stunt with her
We do it sweet, they look bitter
Look at her get up, I hear 'em say
But why him? I hear 'em hate
I laugh at it rather than jab at it

Man that boy bad, man that boy spaz
'Til he crash like Sandra Bullock and Luda on the ave
He changed his name, he a conscious rapper
Naw mutha'fucka I'm just Compton's rapper
I might spit some intricate shit for retards not to get
But really I'm just as rude as Marshall Mathers
Is that a contradiction? He contradicting himself again?
Of course that's a contradiction, the fuck you think life is?
We not like like Christ is
We all want ices and devices to make the bitches say I like this
People don't understand why I went southpaw
I looked in the mirror and said I can't be like y'all
I can't be like Game, I can't be like Eazy
To get in this rap game, I know it won't be easy
Cause my shit different
I know
He from Compton, where he from, have he killed before?
Truth is, I ain't the most ruthless, but I'm not cupid
Before she had two kids my momma worked two gigs
To get out Chicago
To move right back to another ghetto,on Sante Fe playing the lotto
I used to want a champagne two door Tahoe
Until I seen that same truck shot by five-o
Dead with his eyes closed, y'all should've seen him
Off a gallon of cough syrup, but rifles had leaned him
That's why these tough rappers man I don't believe 'em
Y'all wanna be 'em, I wanna grab bats and beat 'em
So they can feel the pain of the blocks I'm from
Where my heart turned numb
And the powder and the shells come up off that gun
Come up off your chain, or come up off your life and have a fatherless son
It's the syllabus for the ignorant militant mind
'quivalent crimes for jail sentencin'
No one preventin' this war

Sure as the edges on every ocean, now let's explore
The Kendrick Lamar LP I been promotin' for 'bout a month
Don't worry its comin' soon, like a fast nut
I never be gassed up, some labels they passed up
Now the industry crashin', I guess they got bad luck
Your bad, you don't write neither? There goes another fad
Shit I write ether
I get it in like the Vanna on Wheel of Fortune forcin' your forfeit
With the strength of the prime forces of four fork lifts
This is very extra necessary
This extra scary,this is Amityville
This the Exorcist on ecstasy pills
And if I can't do it my integrity will
Head dog wishes, every Compton bitch is
I mean this shit is
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
They all got a fat ass but lower case titties
Now I gotta mix and match, jungle fever, white and black
Double D, Brittney, Becky get your mouth intact
Reg call 'em Jabberjaw, she gon' hop skip and jog
Just to read my twitter blog
Man these hoes pitiful
And to you bloggers that say I'm weak
You know how long I took to chop this fuckin' beat?

Thanks I‰Ûªm Dave very nice to meet

No problem, sir, let me just say
I‰Ûªm a big fan of the shit that y‰Ûªall make
I can‰Ûªt lie, I been thinking about this all day


Sure, I was undergrad down there in Richmond

Oh, you talking bout my hometown?

I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham
It was in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around

I wouldn‰Ûªt say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap

Well I ain‰Ûªt never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school
Like I was doing shit I had to do so when I finished undergrad, I‰Ûªm cool and I can get whatever job I wanted

Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that
Know you been racing them rats, you ain‰Ûªt been making them raps


Man, my Bar Mitzvah money
But don‰Ûªt diss me buddy, I wasn‰Ûªt one of them younguns up on the block who had nothing to lose
I must‰Ûªve wanted this a lot, I had something to choose

Yeah, I guess

Oh my god, it‰Ûªs the best
Bitches let me draw up on their breasts
Literally I can reinvent myself
I get a forum to project myself
It‰Ûªs never boring, every morning I wake up and try to best myself
I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself
It‰Ûªs kinda healthy

Sure

Uh, I wouldn‰Ûªt do shit
And I don‰Ûªt even get what that got to do with this?


Nah, that‰Ûªs my niche!
Don‰Ûªt get offended by this, but that‰Ûªs the market y‰Ûªall missed
That‰Ûªs the target I‰Ûªll hit
And that‰Ûªs the heart of my pitch
I wanna do this whole thing different

Uh, you know, I-I think, like, you know
Traditionally people have been doing the job the same kind of way for a long time

Nah, like, I get that, but I-I just think that, you know
You don‰Ûªt know if it could be working even better
And I think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out
I don‰Ûªt mean any disrespect by that
I‰Ûªm just saying I have a different background
Like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant

[Verse 2: Lil Dicky &amp;]

Well my flow is crazy, I can switch that amazing
For example, I can be like ain‰Ûªt nobody fucking with Lil Dicky
When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous
Ripping this shit like it‰Ûªs never been did and the rhythm is never predictable
Cause I can switch it, deliver this shit to whatever cadence you bitches prefer

Top of that, lyrically I‰Ûªm pretty damn clever (Go)
Got a long bottom bitch, called a hoe Neville (Whoa)
And I blow it from the jump, Derrick Rose knee (Oh)
You can say I‰Ûªm pretty smart how I know better
And y‰Ûªall been winning like Pistorius, it‰Ûªs no feat
Bro, I can go on and on
I‰Ûªm taking over and they mad like father-in-laws

Well I don‰Ûªt know if they can run it like that
But ain‰Ûªt nobody else doing funny type rap

Well I can tell a story about my morning
Watching Boy meets World and jerking off to Topanga Lawrence
Like the 14 year old Topanga

Nah it ain‰Ûªt like that I just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual
Like, as a guy
So when I get up on the mic I ain‰Ûªt finna just lie
Real recognize real, right?

Well, I don‰Ûªt care about the money
Like, it‰Ûªs the respect that I‰Ûªm wanting
Honestly, I just want to be one of the greats
Where they gotta bring your boy up every debate
I don‰Ûªt wanna leave the game the same

Well, I wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand up rap
With the random rap and the man like that for the people that was anti-rap
Yet, the fans of rap started recognizing anti-rap is ironically one of the real brands of rap left

I guess, I wanna be the best
I just wanna do it my way
And turn the whole game sideways
And show people you ain‰Ûªt gotta be resigned to the highway
You can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight

Well thanks, man, that‰Ûªs my plan of my attack
Just let me in and I‰Ûªmma rap the plaques
And I ain‰Ûªt about to win them back to back
I‰Ûªm bout to win them like it‰Ûªs back to back to back to back to back
Til I stop rapping

True

You misread me

Well that‰Ûªs one of my flaws, I‰Ûªm too competitive dawg

,
I get that I gotta prove myself

But think about that though
Only doing this a couple of years
One tape and I‰Ûªm like this?

You don‰Ûªt think finding out would be worth it?


Wait, like, like I have the job? Like really?

You want me to make a hook up right now?

Alright, uh, okay

I‰Ûªm bout to be professional
Homie, I‰Ûªm professional
Uh, maybe like a low voice type thing?

Well, you know, I feel like there might have been some upside to it
But I‰Ûªm not good at thinking of things on the spot like that
Don‰Ûªt y‰Ûªall normally like outsource for that kind of thing sometimes?

Yeah, you know, I‰Ûªm just way better when I get to think things through
Have my like that dual screen action that type of thing

Right now?

Sure

[Outro: Lil Dicky,&amp; (Juanita)]

Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)

And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earning her man
And learning her man (and at the same time burning her man)
Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)

I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

Well I'm peeping and I'm creeping and I'm creep-in
But I damn near got caught, cause my beeper kept beeping
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection,the selection
Symbolizes dope, take atoke but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do


It's like this and like that and like this and uh

Getting funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N double-O P
D O double G Y, D O double G, ya see
Showing much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimping hoes and clocking a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some mothafuckin' G shit
(Hell yeah)so Dre (What's up Dogg?)
Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off something (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumping, (City of Compton)


Is where it takes place so, when asked, your attention
Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynching
Dropping the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie: they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, cause if I slip then I'm slipping
But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight tripping
And I'mma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach

I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized,I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them

Shit


Life can be like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artists' like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me


Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down


And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said


Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' wit a flashy wrist
My defense, mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well that's me at these awards
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...


Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down


And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse

Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey

Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 nigga
Guess who's back
Still doing that shit huh Dre?
(Oh for sho', check me out)


It's still Dre Day nigga,AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage,but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? my last album was(nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed
They wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name
I'm ahead of my game
Still puffing my leafs
Still fuck with the beats,still not loving police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets,repping 213 (for life)
Still the beats bang,still doing my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

(x2)
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
Still hitting them cornersin them lo-lo's, girl
(Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E)


Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed, I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since Turn Out the Lights from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it,after-mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

[Hook: Snoop Dogg (Dr. Dre)] (x3)


It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on the corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners on the lo-lo's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back(So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless




Right back up in ya mothafuckin' ass,9-5 plus four pennies!
Add that shit up,D-R-E right back up on top of thangs

Walkin' down the streets of L.A
Stay strapped cause niggas bust caps every day, yo

Droppin' like this and like that
Rat-tat-tat-tatwith their caps peelin' back

You catch heat from fuckin' with' the D-R-E

Back on the streets with my khakis and my scars
Nuts full of cavi and I'm headed for the bar
Scared as a motherfucker, cause I'm fresh out
But I got to make my green,and plus they all fiend
Follow me, they keep yellin' murder, but it won't stop
Until the last nigga that you know drop
Another nigga out, but I doubt that you really give a fuck what it's about
Now, 99 pigs on a block with me
Not a motherfuckin' cop wanna knock with me

A chrome 38,a Fo'ty-fo' mag,and mack 10

Strong motherfucker cause he starts to crawl
I guess I gots to load the Glock again
Hit 'im with the hollow points and watch him spin
Fuck it, I had to do this quick
Grabbed the Glock 17,the clip went click
Tried to detect, but did not detect perfect
So I creep on that ass, pops him and drops him
That ought to stop from beatin' up blacks
Dead in his tracks, from a full six pack
Relax, cause I'm about to take my respect
I aimed the twelve gauge straight for his neck
Boo-yaa! Boo-yaa! then I fade into the wind

I used to sneak and smoke stress weed

On a mission to the money, sun down till it sunny
Know my family love me
Ridin' in the car with two niggas and a pistol
This ain't funny, I do it all for the money, hold up
Slowly as I pull up to the donut stand, I already know the plan
Hop out and get on your mans and take what he got
Go through pockets, wallets and socks, dig all the knots
It's a stick-up, phone ring, it's my mama
In the middle of some drama, so I don't pick up
Thinking I gotta get my shit up, I gotta pick my bitch up
Let's hurry up and leave, I feel the police near us
So we left with a thousand dollars cash

And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray

They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floating in the black Benz, trying to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm trying to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

Me and Kurupt with my pound to the floor
Got a whole lot of gas but I don't know which way to go
I'm trying to find a white bitch a little snow bunny
Cause the word on the streets is they like to give a nigga money
(Me and big snoop nothing but some players
Looking at the bitch except she thinking 'bout the paper
Tryna get cracking, actress with the action
I'ma tell you with the words nigga what's happenin')
The police is on my dick cuz they all up on my face
Put some yola on a nigga then they run up in my place
Got that thang in the trunk, 3 cases in a month
I don't give a fuck; Kurupt let me get that blunt
(Cause we just tryna get it; the money and the game
Stepping in this motherfucker, talent tucker, undercover, bang
And then bustin' on these undercover bustas
Just to G up in the game, rollin on them thangs)

I got gators on my feet; khakis on my leg
Braids in my hair, super dome, super head
Said she gotta lick with it, wanted me to get with it
[?] is how we do it, moving real slick with it
(Yea I heard she the best at it; chew it up like spinach
Chew it up 'till she finish; man this bitch is not a gimmick
She's a pro, super ho, she got that super throat)
Living on your own, jibbin' on the phone
Forgivin' when you're wrong
Yea, but that's a whole 'nother conversation
Listen to me spit it to you with this meditation
(Yo, let's get this money bitch
I got the now or later gators on gangsta shit
Just a little bit, listen to this shit
Just a little bit of game spittin' to this bitch)

See you walking on the blue carpet music playing loud
King of the west coast Mr. Big Bow Wow
Ice cream sammich with the grab bag saggin'
Cap illar, I'ma steeler, got the gold rag flaggin'
(I got 31 flavors
3 of my bitches was exclusively used to be neighbors
'Till I threw that game on they table
Now they do whatever for me if they're able)
My little homie told me when he was 20 years old
I'm in love with a bitch, I told him fuck that ho
See I'm his role model with happy dog bottle
Puttin' paint where it ain't, break a bitch; you think I can't?
(I'm just hard in the paint, I'ma do what you can't
Pimpin make a bitch faint; I'ma circle then straight
Get the gat, get the tape nigga, 9, 38

Uh,This one's for the g's,all black chucks on the cuffs on my jeans
King size papers stuffed full of trees,I be with the boss dawg yall fuck niggas fleas
Now they say I'm hot hundred something degrees,taking pictures with a young nigga cheese
Remember days homey, I ain't had a thing
Now I'm hopping off the plane putting roaches on the wing
And my hoes like queens,but we smoke like kings
Jewelery froze like bling, money come fastyou're slow like lean
Rolling up grass, sold weed to half the staff, so I know i‰Ûªm gonna pass
Third period, Showing up last with a late note blowing grey smoke


When I pull up people so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us


We blow to the middle of the day
Wiz say dawg put a little in the jay
Hey, why not? Not why?
We fly, we ride,she high, he high, we high
Fuck it, everybody to the library
Got a new batch, some blue, boo-berry
Stuck in the hallway, we pass he say dog he just smoke all day
It's a mind game, like the lean I seen to keep migranes
Ritchie Valens,and bitch I'm freaking limeade
I'm so lifted, like a parachute

Slip away, dip away,almost had to throw a zip away
But fuck that, this the taylor gang, what you want dog Shit I'm on everythang

Don‰Ûªt be talking like a star if you ain‰Ûªt got that life
I don‰Ûªt even remember what went down last night
I‰Ûªm ‰Û÷bout to be ready to go out, damn right
They tryna holla ‰Û÷cause I‰Ûªm flyer than a first class flight
Now they love it how I flow on these bitches
H-h-hit the stage and put on a show for these bitches
I‰Ûªm different, don‰Ûªt put me in the same boat as these bitches
God forbid if I‰Ûªm ever looking as broke as these bitches
When I pose for these pictures
I‰Ûªm a rare breed, exactly what these bitches can‰Ûªt be
The way I do my thing makes them all [?] Stanley
Eighteen, and I‰Ûªm barely legal
And I‰Ûªm wearing a little something, something barely see through
Now I‰Ûªm throwing shade to the haters, we can barely see you
Cause they waiting on Valifornia, this is just a preview
Of what we do in the Valley, I got my friends all around me
And shit‰Ûªs about to get rowdy, cause every night is a party




Don't watch the clock, watch the moves I make
The cake I bake, steak to steak, the rules I break
Realistically, you in the midst of me
What you want and what you are and what's your fantasy?
Party people in the place to be
I see that she and y‰Ûªall do agree with me
And we will be, Raven be the she with me
Ain‰Ûªt nothing puffing like chief and G
The key to me, the pimp-hop philosophy
Listen how my words slide right on beat
Walk your dog like Fido beat
Left hind leg up, now pee on the tree
Oh yeah, we killing them Loc
We the bombest, I‰Ûªm honest and iller than most
West Coast motherfucker, ‰Û÷til the sun burnt up
It‰Ûªs five in the morning, we still turnt up

Ready to go off any minute so you feel it
Because of the law, I had to conceal it
If you fuck around you gone make me reveal it ay


Tool on deck, why would I lie?
Nigga you a pussy, hope you got 9 lives
I can hit a nigga with the 9, 9 times
Country ass boy, country like LeAnn Rimes
Mississippi D-Banner and Lil Weezyana
Everybody got tools so you will need a hammer
I'm a pill poppin' animal, syrup sippin' nigga
I'm so high you couldn't reach me with a fucking antenna
You fucking with this man, you can be this man's dinner
The 9 give me brains but the AK add liver
The rapper is insane flowing like a mad river
Make your ass quiver like you naked at winter
Hollygrove honcho, hard time giver
I'm a shark in the water, you just Long John Silver
I got a girl, you wanna meet her?
Her name is 9 millimeter




If I got 9 slugs, 9 bullets gone fly
If I got a red beam, 9 people gone die
9 mamas gone cry, 9 spirits in the sky
9 preachers preaching, 9 sermons telling 9 lies
Cause each and every one of y'all 9 niggas wasn't shit
I would have rather kept the 9 rugers in the ruger clip
The index finger slipped, the 9 let 9 spit
I lick em all like eighteen tits on 9 chicks
I'm a suicide risk, 9 slits on each wrist
If I die 9 times the next go-arounds a bitch
And if I come back, I'll throw 99 shows
And shove 9 inches of dick in 99 hoes




I'm a west coast original,black John Wayne
Nigga where we from we like to pop that thang
You better stop that, mang
Fat mouth to Dogg and I'ma pop-pop-bang
Pigs wanna bust me, hoes wanna suck me
Niggas wanna touch me, none of that, trust me
I'm too slick, too sly, never snitch, I let it ride
I set aside all my feelings when I'm killing like a villain
Move quick like a cheetah, I'm a killa,I ain't here to lock up
I flash the heater, then lock your whole block up
Dip-dop-deeter Banner turn the beat up
Illa-fo-reala my nilla dilla never caught
You niggas always acting hard
I keep a 9 millimeter in my waist and got 2 more in the car
Yeah you're all about to get it so quit it, tryin' to conceal it
You'll fuck around and make me reveal it, so killas kill it

It all goes back, to '85
When I start gettin pussy every day of my life
It really didn't matter what the bitch look like
I remember one night,after the Sugar Ray fight
Wouldn't you believe it, Dogg like a retriever
I went up in this big fat bitch named Treva
She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her, yessir
Ain't no pressure, later that semester
She put me down with her homegirl name Tanisha
She was so vicious, lips so luscious
Suck a nigga dick and have it shinin like some dishes
Patricia, Patricia, she love the way I stick her
I take her to the movies and now, she eat the dick up
Big bucks, no whammies
I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy
She lived in the Valley, she couldn't understand me
But she let me dig out, her homegirl named Brandi
Now Brandi was a cute little thick bitch
She moved to the hood from the 2-0-6
She brought some new tricks, flippin them squirrels
And the pearls, and turnin out the neighborhood little girls
Hmm, and I seen that, so I peep the game
So I put her down, bottom bitch on my team
And we began makin, breakin bitches takin
Whatever we want, see she want with the fakin
It's real in the field, no mistakin
And crack the little bitch, yeah she Jamaican
Time and time again she would bring me bud
And let me beat it up, listenin to ""One Love""
Off some jerk chicken, I got mo' bitches
Now I'm fuckin her sister it's gettin real suspicious
But the dick is good, so they won't tell
And now they next door neighbor, Clarissa Bell
She been lookin at me, I think she wanna hit
But I'mma holla back, cause I'm on another bitch
I'm on some other shit, I got a phone call
From the motherfuckin president y'all
He said, ""Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch
And make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?""
I called and look here, this what you do
Make the First Lady sell a little pussy for you
I think he got it, cause he left fast
He left his daughters, and a lot of cash
Well what do ya know, D-O-double-G
Major pimpin, out in D.C
And I'm a young pimp, got a lot of growin left
And you's a young ho with a lot of hoein left
Always keep a ho in check, blowin us a train wreck
Yeah I might have to go in depth
See every little ho I met
They're standouts, you know the ones like Yvette
We fucked in the car, behind a bar
I shot it in her face and it went ""Ahhh""
My homeboy Charles
Went up in his sister, behind the garage
I was menace, I was freaky, I was sick
When y'all was tryin to hump, I was teachin them to suck dick
Always tryin to go up in a ho
Got caught tryin to fuck in school they asked me what I did it fo'
You know just what I told her?
I love pussy, and this dick is what I showed her
And now they threw me out, now I'm at the pad
I'm at a new school, way cool
New hoes, new script, fresh fish
Walk up in the room and I bust a new bitch
I'm in some new tail, wanna holla back
But for now let me holla back Impala black
She's a 12th grader, in my science class
And I done seen the pussy, yeah boy I'm movin fast
See I was taught by, and I was taught I
Better move on somethin fast if I thought I
Could claim a dame, or game her brain
Or tame a man, not with the same old game
See on some different stuff, I'm a different cut
It's what I say and do to make the bitch give it up
Oh you wanna brag? I wanna brag too
Now what you gon' do, when they ask you
Is you gon' tell a lie, or you gon' keep it G
Or you gon' hold it all inside or you gon' tell on me?
Shit it's all cool, cause it was all good
It's just another day in Doggy Dogg's neighborhood
You better watch your girl, cause if she on the loose
It's a 90 percent chance she gon' get pimp juice
Now what it do, what it is
Now you livin with that ho and y'all got fo' kids

This is DJ Eazy Dick
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass
With a fat dick


When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over
AndI'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world


Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking endo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it

With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon do
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em


Hey now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four tohit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling

They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it


You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are


It's like you're always looking for a problem
But there ain't enough equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
Take the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em
They ain‰Ûªt ever had my back like you got it
They ain't never had a chance, how you got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it

She texts me ""How's you love life?""
And ""How are you?"", I said ""I'm good""
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together
Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever
She says whatever
I says whatever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer?
HSTRY sweater
Serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my batch and I'm straight
Esco


You ain't gotta question it, oh

Yeah, yeah
Ayo, black, it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Straight out the fucking dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo... now


Rappers, I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holding an M16, see with the pen I'm extreme,now
Bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes,hand me a nine and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay
I keep some E&amp;J, sitting bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner betting Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughing at baseheads tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick,forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscing about the last time the Task Force flipped
Niggas be running through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the Mac-10 was in the grass and
I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
Pick the Mac up, told brothers, ""Back up,"" the Mac spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran ‰ÛÒ I made him backflip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck""
Try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So now I'm jetting to the building lobby
And it was full of children probably couldn't see as high as I be
(So what you sayin'?)It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pulling the triggers bringing fame to their name
And claim some corners,crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stickup kids ‰ÛÒ they run up on us
45's and gauges, Macs, in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatching your cracks in black
There was a snitch on the block getting niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she's got to smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers in measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation, inside information
Keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind

[Hook] (x4)
New York state of mind


Be having dreams that I'm a gangsta,drinking Moets,holding Tecs
Making sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks,sewing up the blocks to sell rocks
Winning gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walking with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith &amp; Wesson, I have niggas undressin'
Thinking of cash flow, buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'm a hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays,bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back,black
I'm living where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack,I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, holmes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blaming us, we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I've taken rappers to a new plateau,through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm an addict for sneakers, 20's of buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

Ain't no best‰ÛÒEast, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest/face gone
How could Nas be garbage?
Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome
Come out of my throne

Name a rapper that I ain't influenced

With Hawaiian Sophie fame,kept my name in his music

Talk about me, laugh behind my back but in my face
Y'all some well wishers, friendly acting, envy hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take
When these streets keep calling, heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
Started cocking up my weapon, slowly loading up this ammo
To explode it on acameland his soldiers
I can handle this for doloand his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G,dick-sucking lips
Why don't you let the late, great veteran live?

What's sad is I love you cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child,I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissing women
Were you abused as a child? Scared to smile? They called you ugly?
Well life is harsh; hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was getting chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smiling in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearing Jaz chains, no Tecs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hanging with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy,a Stan
I still whip your ass; You thirty-six in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho,tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though

Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy

And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?

And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas

In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas

With whiskers like a rat,compared to Beans you whack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame

Visualizing the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as 5 Percenters
But something must've got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some resting in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others such as myself are tryna carry on tradition
Keeping this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leaving thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough, so
Until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keeping it real, packing steel, getting high
Cause life's a bitch and then you die


Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go


I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one,cuss while I pus from
My skull cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin foreigners take they wallets, they jewels, and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
Got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of saying ""fuck tomorrow""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

It's yours
Whose world is this?
[Nas]: The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?


I sip the Dom P, watchingtil I'm charged
Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
Behold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme - play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation,react like I'm facing
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracing
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruising in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it; the beats make me falling asleep
I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me(say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me(say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me




To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches,aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-sticking wild golden child
Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days we sell it: smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to JesÌ¼s,soakin' their sins in trays
Of holy water,odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction
How you living, large -- a broker charge,cards are mediocre
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?




I'm the young city bandit hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps - I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturing my peeps not eating can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana,stabbing women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes,burning dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop,checkin' dames
Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today




Yea aight?

To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours (It's yours!)

Hey yo D
Let's go all the way in on this one


Some of the smartest dummies
Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies
An' a flag on a moon
And can't find food for the starving tummies
Pay no mind to the youths
Cause it's not like the future depends on it
But save the animals in the zoo
Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money
This is how the media pillages
On the TV the picture is
Savages in villages
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids, huh
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images
And this is what the image is
You buy a khaki pants
And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones
An' a thief out gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see
And that's all they will ever show
So the ones in the West
Will never move East
And feel like they could be at home
Dem get tricked by the beast
But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?
Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord

[Hook] x2


Yeah, Sabali. Thats patience.That's what the old folks told me
Discovering the World before this World.A World buried in time
Uncover with rhymes. It gets no realer


Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?
We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?
Can you read thoughts? can you read palms?
Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?
The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off
Now the Earth is round
If the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh
The average man can't prove of most of the things
That he chooses to speak of
And still won't research and find out
The root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze
And that's when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut
Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wet mud
Can you read signs? can you read stars?
Can you make peace? can you fight war?
Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh
Can you survive? Against all odds, now?

[Hook] x2


It's crazy when you feed people the truth you don't know how they're gonna react
You're scared of wrong doers, people that just ignorant
You're scared of the truth, be patient for now


Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?
And was it a lightning storm
That gave birth to the Earth
And then dinosaurs were born? damn
Who made up words? Who made up numbers?
And what kind of spell is mankind under?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it
Microwaved it and try it
No matter what we'll survive it
What's hue? What's man? What's human?
Anything along the land we consuming
Eatin', deletin', ruin
Trying to get paper
Gotta have land, gotta have acres
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson
Watch niggas play the game like the Lakers
In a world full of 52fakers
Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers
You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders
Make a wish for the day cuz
Like somebody got a doll of me
Stickin' needles in my arteries
But I can't feel it
Sometimes it's like 'part of me, but I got a real big spirit'
I'm fearless.... I'm fearless
Don't you try and grab hold of my soul
It's like a military soldier since seven years old
I held real dead bodies in my arms
Felt their body turn cold, oh
Why we born in the first place
If this is how we gotta go?
Damn

Seventeen rocks gleam from one ring

There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of living, Vegas-style roll dice in linen
Antera spinning on Millenniums
Twenty G bets I'm winning 'em

Lex with TV sets the minimum
Ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains
A case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique, with the semi-tech who want it

I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat
Tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wilding
Talkin' bout how you ran the Island in '89
Laying up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked a baby 9,that nigga gravy mine
Clanked him
What was he thinkin' on my corner when it's pay me time?
Dug 'em, you owe me cousin something told me plug him
So dumb, felt my leg burn then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came asking me my name, what the fuck
I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep, watching all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun,and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through,blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' L's sipping Coors on all floors in project halls

Yo, dude is 31, livin in his moms crib
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair,still slingin,got a crew
They break his moms furniture, watchin Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smokin L's
In the same spot he stood since eighty-five, well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Saved by his mom's, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin on, different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood




Baby girl she's always talkinname droppinhangin late
Drinkin smokin hates her baby daddy,craves shoppin
E poppin Ecstasy takin,won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin,stuck with limitations
Lustin men, many hotels,Fendi Chanel
With nothin in her bank account frontin she do well
Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job never stay workin,mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin she the same person, never matures
All her friends married doin well
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin like she was 12
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights
Selfish in her own right for life,guess she's in her second childhood

I mean, they come from an era who made a lot of money of that shit
I wonder if it fucked with their conscience
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking themselves up like that on the shit
And that's where the money came from

X2
48, 48, 48 states I get it in
48, 48, 48 states I get it in
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow
I can get it for the low


Shit is getting warmer on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners
Your mother is a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shit's getting harder
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore ain't saw ya
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you‰Ûªre accustomed what you‰Ûªre used to
So you bought two, nigga
They coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind and it‰Ûªs all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent
I am the reason your family is using and shooting up, it‰Ûªs my fault
You can blame me motherfucker, for killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger, all I wanted was a cheeseburger
And a little chain, tuck, didn‰Ûªt realize this game fucked up some lives
‰ÛÏOh, how‰Ûªs mine?‰Û -- my conscience eats it up all the time
But other than that I‰Ûªm fine, I got a little money in my pocket

Nigga, we broke as fuck
Homie got a chop shop I stole that truck
And I sold that dope
Motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke
But like my work I give no fucks, I‰Ûªm sorry
She could have been a doctor, nigga, I‰Ûªm sorry
Could have been a actor and won that Oscar, said, I'm sorry
I sold that soap and I killed black folk, I‰Ûªm sorry
But I got a nice car, put my sister through school
While my momma all cool, I'm sorry
I'm in too deep and I can‰Ûªt see the shore, I'm sorry


You get addicted to the flip, we used to call it
You get addicted to the flip, the transaction, the hustling
Even more than the money, it's just your job
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person, and to do this and do that
You become the go to guy forever and next thing you know you‰Ûªre in too deep
Way too deep, scare the shit out of you
You wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death
It's important for us to realize man, we gotta get out of that, man
Dudes is buying choppers to shoot down people that look just like them
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other, nobody wins

From my man Steve Stoute's birthday
Happy birthday nigga
Peepin'



Motha fuckin' fake ass bastards
Steve Stoute the commissioner nigga

Player hating on me
Wanna be me
Check out my crew nigga



What we have here
Is the firm y'all
Introducing...
Nas Escobar
Noreaga
Nature
And Femme Fatale



Black pirellis rolling over this makaveli
Two platy LPs
Still the feds tap my celli
Made a mil and another mil
Just signed another deal
From the bridge ever summer deal
Niggas run to steal
Cracks and bundles
Wanna be down ask Jungle
React humble but we blast guns too
Now to son you is a deeper plan
So when I jam
Reach the pan
Check the sale let the sound scan
Keep a brown tan
From vacationing
Chicks in Vegas
Tryna guess us how much we made to spin
Two Tiphannys from the Colosseum
Green olive BMs
Tracks from TM lack when we see em
Grip the heat
When the sixth season
Jump out the S4s
And test yours
Tudor watches
Allah watches
Stubborn, you won't admit that Escobar got this
On top let me explain what the cock is
Firm Biz came livin'
Naturally fly, diamond rings glistenin'
Make it seem sickenin'
What's really ill is how the team's clickin'
Femme Fatale on some dope shit
Flow sick we stay incorporate
Firm giving you a dosage
Of high explosives
You kidnap we kidnap
You blast shit, I did that
Cuttin' through the chase we bring it to where you live at
I wouldn't play you
I'd rather try you by your label



Miss maximillion
Exotic diamonds let it charm
Legal life of bear arms
Protecting my squad from harm
Murder, Danger
Backstabbers and snakes
Murderers and Jakes
Spend thugs but the drugs a case
Fuck y'all feel
And them accusations you make me
Wow femme fatale we increasing the stakes
Platinum plates choosin' isles
Like my cheese willie style
850 on the dig and if you see me



Major league mamis
With the bodies
Got your clique quick to buy these
Who wanna try these?
Firm colleagues
Somali's, think they're badass
16 bars on that ass
Y'all niggas shat ass
Ali aye quatro
Play the passenger of chaco
6 to got though
Think you hot but you not though
Play the corner
Be the type of bitch to run up on ya
Much longer
While y'all get short bread like launa
You're a goner
Rhyme shoota, top shootas
With the lugas true das
Stats rulas
Firm biz grab the cougas



It be the firm biz getting it off
Slow regez the elegant black prince
We take the top gator
Black and shrotopass like im a raider
Sophistacater
Hang tight like dre right
Flow like hawian in the broad day light
I give all that I have
All in my power to see the day
That the crowd weighted
You expired and outdated
Re segregated
None of my people graduated
Ain't no progress in the projects
It's the same process
Rise to the top of New York
Keep the digest
Through all my cornets
Global solar
It's young omar
The shuffuler
We analyze who they really are
Familiar, blow holes into your interior
You minute, little man
You think you general?



I put the hinds betters
Fake thugs styles glued together
Saying old rhymes show signs
You're through whatever
Eat your heart out
I play my part now
Fiend to be part of the squad
But I'm not gonna be shot down
Who's how now? I'm disgusted at you
Rap doo doo
It's funny if you let these cats fool you
The whole no wait
Your values dying at a slow rate
Opposition track live niggas pop gats
Been doin' this since the days of hot tracks
Claimin' you in the firm how's that?
When you got your spot jacked
Read between the lines
The foulest dreams was lead to blind
Tonight is excellence redefined
In the form of Nature, Noreaga
Nas, Mary J. Blige
Femme Fetale on the rise
Manager extraordinaire
My man, Jungle
Pussy rebundled like desert plans
Spitting vivid raps
My whole clique rocking fitted hats
Millionaire status play the block give it back
Thanks to who?
My pen names tight like langston hughes
Generating chips, picking which banks to choose
Clever robberies, on deposits
I got this, why niggas on the blocks
Stare at bitches gossip
I pop shit so understand me
From day one I rap whole new guns
That run in the family

So much beef, police surprised I ain't dead yet
I keep red tech in the passenger seat
To match their heat
It's so real if I don't see you I'm splashing your beep
It's on the kid
Whoever gets his first
It's going to kids dirt
My soldiers be cold blooded vultures
And cold blooded
Yo on the street we control hundreds
I drink polatas so all my people roll blunted
Your man froze when I rolled up
I symbolize death like a cobra
Attacks your life here it's over
Black you effed up
Never should've messed up
My black cocksucker scared to die tough luck
You know my steelo im likeAl Pacino
YoNas Escobargrab the mic and flex a bar


I'm in the black limo
Jack Daniel through the crack window
I spot the fake red dot his face like a Hindu
Grab the symbol

Essential amounts you owe to the fam crew
Firm affiliation paper chasing
Chip glossy rich pablo es cubano
Sophisticano
Yo blazing halos like shadow
Yo nigga im the castro
Im coming through on your wack crew

Ay yo I get mines
Well enough to be considered big time
My crew a chosen few legit minds
Who live prime
Shorty's on some fly stuff
Admitted that can't resist mines
Mahogany complexion
Body probably dressed in
My ill tommy hill collection
When I be flexin', sketch it
My selection of words are type effective
When I rhyme words are verbalized remain present
In mines, I'm like an with air macs nikes on
Recite nice on micsstrike like a python
My gold chain with ice on lookin' trife on
My Jacuzzi filled with tight warm relaxed lookin steaming
Lounging like a falcon on a mountain top at Egypt
Cats schemin when they see my rocks gleaming
Mega shine forever rhyme wicked like a demon
Where my charcoal, new balance a lot yo
The narcs go knocked my man Marco
His money was marked yo
I regulate a sharp flow
But in my life bucaso
My mom died when I was five and never left my heart yo
I symbolize rive alive niggas
Ghetto's where I live
Considered my rhyme the oasis
Because rap was a desert
And I helped minds escaped it
Yo Nas link it up it's like an ill typed bracelet



Fake thug, no love
You get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low
I didn't know til I was drunk though
You freak cats get played out
Get robbed and laid out
Prostitute turned snitch
I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jumped out the Range
Empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'ze make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, thirty-two shots
Ya'll niggas don't want none of this



Ayo check it my man Joe Shan is downstairs
My man Georgie is lounging downstairs
My man Big Ice he lounging in Queensbridge
And all you real cats know what time it is
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
Now check the new verse
Check the new verse it's ill
Yo my millennium got people mind prisoner
Pain digital wood brain material
Rims spin sinister
Grin like John Dillinger
Iced out medallions my style will keep killin' ya
Misery and jealousy when you envision me
I'm getting mines and still livin' on the strength of me
You never bust nothin' or got ill touched nothin'
My baby face ice grill I heard something for real
In any cipher i'll serve em like a viper
I go for mines like I go for time on Rikers
Steelo like pacino benzino benz bilo we know
People we dope like mafiaso like gambino

I like sony cause they saw my man keeno
Can't forget my home girl Faith Newman

Pumping on corners beat downs and stick ups

Selling cracks getting ready to attack with nines and mac elevens
You know my style
You can't stop what knocks me down

It's sort of like the conclusion to ""Color Purple""
Brothas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop verses the block, shorties is too quick
Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung
Where Brothas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia
The cognac plurger plus the trees
But whose the faul one to make his nose take a freeze
And got enough gold to rock ice in all hype
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white feinds and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers
Astoria walls with cypress, but yo that's another subject
I love teks let's get it off
Yo what up what up



Yo funkmaster flex you know I got the ill lex
I wear my guests in apendix
And cash my cheque in flesh shit
My man escobar be lighting a weed
And I proceed with all the ill types of rhymes you need
I'm not the new jack, or crew rack I'm like the next man
Cormega, I just got signed to Def Jam
My man Nas is down with me
A lot of sucker rappers they can't diss me
It's like that, you know it's like that
We'll strike back Queensbridge style
My mobb deep people is mad foul
A juvenile delinquent wet your prequit
I get my money numerous occasions
It's frequent my man Ike
Tried to avalanche ice watch
You know my steelo Al Pacino

Two of em pull through but one didn't, son's finished,you took the life of him

Born on June 4th - the mind of a Gemini
Plight of a societal OutKast - Aquemeni
You bought a hammer just to silence the clamour
For another real G on the block, after your man got popped
When shots rang out, you ran for cover
Bought your first gun, spent a couple grand for another four
Told your mom you was preparing for war
She signed the shape of the cross each time you ran out the door
But you ain't never had the mind of a killer
You was more of an actor - with the movement of a small time dealer
When the feds came they got you for light work
Facing a few years, defence attorney told you it might work
To cop a plea and turn informant - you could save a few tenants
And at the same time reduce your sentence
You wore a wire to the home of your old supplier
And when they raided, you ain't make it - you was caught in the fire

Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half
Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty

It was real, fo'real I was fucking with mills and he was frag-ile
We wyling, the brown stallion
Stay styling, on the low fouling
The whole Firm wyling, we lucked it
I know the trick bitch he fuck with, on some duct shit
Heard through the grade that she sucked it
Firm,SosandEsco, mad loco
Fox and Mega for whatever,and through this cheddar
We gon' stay family, 'til we fry though
The fam will never split even if one of us die though
Along with our get go's, we gon' blaze 'til it brick-o's
Peep the Ill-Na-Na, sweet taboo
The Firm tattoo on the Dada
Now tell me what crew hold it down like we do da da?


'Til the death of this, murderous moves pursue effortless
Ice necklace, high priced dressed executives
Peep the grammar, slim built, strong stamina
Forty-four nickel plate long with the silencer
Play for keeps in shut eye you stay sleep
Shit remain deep in get shells thrown at ya Range jeep
Giuliani sweep got all the kings going up the creek
Devil life beers now who's left controlling the streets?
No intelligence, strictly slow niggas minds negligence
It's evident, Feds vest up, raid ya residence
We're all for living, heavyweight Firm division
Mind, I check mine. Eating swine is against my religion
You know the steez, take aim, cock and squeeze
It's the prophecies, not the philosophies of Socrates
Next up? (Yo I believe that's me)
Ayo Mega, represent for the family


Ayo, the Feds got me in the top ten
Cause when my door got knocked in
My four-four main cocked in
My sinister mind, shines like a Dillinger
Mega exhausted, Babyface crime Emperor
Yo, life is based on cultures and creeds
And peep the way drug fiends, the thug nigga sees
I've seen niggas lined up, handcuffed and tied-up
Coke prices rise up when drugs supply dry-up
The Millennium drives up
Rims semi blinds ya eyes temporarily
Mind of Mega be heavily armed for felonies
Shine you could never see
The next fat cat out of NYC
It Was Written like ghetto life hieroglyphics
Living since my real niggas bailed me out of prison
A lot of schemes, cause the narcotics team in Queens
Had marked dollars then the knowledge of fiends
My dream is the legacy of Montana treasury
Fake thugs couldn't even take slugs or bury me


To all thoroughbreds taking the corners, y'all need to join us
Firm's most powerful nation of rap performers
High class, Generals, Confidence, paying lawyers
Swift as Oscar De La Hoya, green beret warriors
Fakes I peep them like the J. Kennedy tape
In the new with Jew busting all in the face
Another word yo, you see through
My man built the Sugar Hill from a sweet tooth
We all eat, cause I speak truth and educated
Black youth, street diploma
Teach Greeks and Romans, but the legacy was stolen
It's a Firm thing, generally gleam
I wrote the theme on how to sell a million
While you crabs is mad at your promotion team
I roll with the nicest Fox
Black ice, pushing Benz without a license
Gear tight as vice grips,Nas got 19 wifies
Seven shiesty, nine of them pisces
Three white meatsunder tight cheese
Wilding,big links is heavy like bricks
That you throw on a pit-bull neck's whilefeeding 'em raw steak
It's core take, more cake
I take the crown of the so called king of the town and lock it down",rap,,,,Nas,Africa Must Wake Up (Ft. Damian Marley & K'naan) prod. by Damian Marley,http://genius.com/Nas-africa-must-wake-up-lyrics,"Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones --
Who are we today?
Yeah, now


The black oasis, Ancient Africa the sacred
Awaking, the sleeping giant,science, art is your creation
I dreamed that we could visit old Kemet
Your history is too complex and rigid for some Western critics
They want the whole subject diminished
But Africa's the origin of all the world's religions
We praise bridges that carried us over
The battle fronts of Sudanic soldiers, the task put before us
(Do you hear me now?)




Who are we today? The slums, diseases, AIDS
We need that all to fade, we cannot be afraid
So who are we today?
We are the morning after, the makeshift youth
The slaveship captured, our diaspora is the final chapter
The ancestral lineage built pyramids
America's first immigrants, the kings and daughters from Nile waters
The first architect, the first philosophers
Astronomers, the first prophets and the doctors were us, us


Now can we all pray?
Each in his own way
Teaching and learning
We can work it out
We'll have a warm bed
We'll have some warm bread
Shelter from the storm dread
And we can work it out
Mother nature feeds all
In fameine and drought
And though selfish in ways, not to share is out
What's a tree without root?
Lion without tooth?
A lie without truth?
You hear me out!

[Chorus - x2, but the second one is:
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
What tomorrow may bring
May some more love come
Yesterday we were kings
I tell ya young bloods
The world is yours today...]

Oh ye people restless in the refusal of peace
And when a man chooses religion, aren't you the ones to kill him?
And when a country is built, aren't you the one's to tear it down?
And when one attempts to tell the truth, aren't you the one's to cut him down?

Distant Relatives
We're all distant relatives, no matter where you from, where you live
How near or far
Africa, China, Japan, Afghanistan, Israel
We're all fam, we're all distant relatives
So that's why we came together -- one of the reasons
Why myself and Damian came together
Cause we all come from one place, and that's Africa
That's right, you too. And you
The whole world!
We're all family, we're just spread out all over the place
So to all my distant relatives, let's take it back home!

Pussy and money the only language I clung ta
Claim ta I mold myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap I'm a monster
Streets deceiving they can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata persona's that of a non-needer
Because I don't need nada except for prada beaver
For cold winters tattoos got my summer's sleeveless
To my g's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up a phoenix caked up
Tryna take what I'm eatin came up a dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this savvy mouth
Wild hardly a man's man who woulda knew
The beach houses and wild parties
Jezebel's and stella mccartney's
For years all that how could I not be dead?
This old german said I was a thug with a notty head
Looked at my benz and called that a nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see
From my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme my stories is
I'm from the home of the thieves

The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder black cop cop a plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers athletes and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances trends and fashion?
But when it comes to residuals they look past us
Woven into the fabric they can't stand us
Even in white tee's blue jeans and red bandannas

Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer
Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars
Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue?
I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew
What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to?
You ain't got the ghetto with you
Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse
Talkin 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about
The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect
Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin is changin, uh
We ain't got no choices who to choose
Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices
And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites
Condoleeza Rice - I don't really get this chick
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools
About poor children, then she gotta prove that she
Ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool
Like these MC's, gotta give 'em the rules
Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose
Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry
On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey
You MC's on that old slavery path
The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh
See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves
Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells
It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win

Up in the steam room chillin', exfoliating the skin
Israeli men conversatin' on ends, probably businessmen
I sense good taste, and they watch us, the spots an expensive place
Manhattan New York, I'm try'na keep steamin'
It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening
This man leans in, his boys laughing
Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens
Says, ""Since all Black women care about is who got dough
And all we do is call them either bitch or a Black ho""
I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold
Since you ignorant, I'mma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree
Most woman who love Giovanni or Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve the Hermes purse
Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime
Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh



I don't care about the runaways
I don't care about who's gay
I don't care about dying of AIDS
But I care if I got paid
Who even cares about the president?
I think they're making a mistake
I don't care about the hurricane
As long as my family's safe
I don't care about the candidates
They burnt this country to bits
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way (Nas: Uh)

Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight (Nas: And ya don't stop, uh)

Half of us been locked up inside the beast,look at the time we see
Brooklyn to Compton streets, Queens, even theCongoneeds dreams
Our bullets and triggers our enemies pullin' on innocent women and children

But I'm not gon' cry, and I'm not gon' just stand and watch you die
I'mma pass you a .9, I'mma grab your hand -- come on let's ride

The same regime,what God has built you never can break
What God has loved you never can hate, man makes rules and laws

I feel hundreds arms grabbin' me, fallin' down the hole
Is it because there is no Gravity my body leaves my Soul
Is the Devil mad at me? will I go to Hell?
Or is it Heaven that awaits me?, is too early to tell
Is it now that I'm to be judged?
Will I face thee bright tunnel warm lights?
Will embrace me before force takes me
Like I'm movin' through high winds
See my self in baby carriages, relatives and friends
Things manifest, kings from every planets rest here
Beams of light hear the voice of the Nazareth near


You 'Amongst Kings' from both far near land
Made in my image son of God son of man
You came in the spirit for I am that I am
Father of all worlds Fallen Angel and the Lamb


Seen my body layin' down in the ground
It was painless, didn't feel a thing
Shots ring felt the anxious to get up and run
I was atheist, committed Suicide
I wish I could erase this shit
I seen a new life before the Christ
He created night &amp; day, the sun &amp; moon
From the virgin woman's womb
We lookin' down at my body, emergency room
Doctors frownin' at me surgical performs, I'm doomed
It's my day of judgment, eternal peace &amp; fire
Far past the stars far past the Orion
I asked that you forgive father, I was tryin'
Many thrones in the light but only one's truly shinin'




Faster then the blinkin' eye, is the master and I
Face to face (uh) fightin' my case so we debate (where?)
Countin' all my sins (ok), where do we begin
When I stabbed the man in the train station or drunk gin
When I grabbed the man let the shells hit him from the Mac 10
It was all retaliation, (from what?) from way back then
Now I got the black Benz (and) trips from Aspen (and)
Disney World for my little girl and I'm askin'
You would recognize all the good deeds I'm worth (Dear God)
Send me on a trip God please the Earth
So I can deliver thou want it, stop playin'

Tantalizing touches, succulent skin, we should wed
Start off broke then stay together 'til we make it big

Never Ike Turner you, but look what you turn and do like

But she young and she speeding, honey now, what's the reason?
You just met this nigga, think you owe him a fucking threesome
So you lustin' to have a baby by a Denver Nugget
You don't love him, you want security, baby, your bugging
Financial liberty you're after,it's how you live
But the blood test shows it's not even his kid




Chanel bags, everything
She shopping every time she gets a wedding ring
This her 3rd marriage,4 carats
Brand new Jag, deserves to have it
Temptation, she can't let go her dirty habits
Mid 30's, spendin' dough at Magic
She's dancin', romancin', she's up at Manson
She fucks all my mans, and they pop themagnums
So now what you gonna do, the morning-after pill is way overdue
'Posed to get married, now you embarassed
Who does this kid belong to?
Promiscuous, cuz'she got touched by step-dad,sex at
Such a young age,if you was a virgin, I'd get mad
Sick society, blaming yourself so wrong
I highly respect you, bet that, strong, intelligent
This song ain't to poke fun of you, to get laughs
I just love you, really love you
Here for you, wanna trust you
Wanna cuff you, be my lady
But first, I gotta see the baby




Ladies, I believe in you
We gotta stop this craziness out here, though
We gotta get right
Because when we both get right, we both take flight
Us real men need you, for real",rap,,,,Common,The Light prod. by J Dilla,http://genius.com/Common-the-light-lyrics,"

Doo-doo-doo, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo YO


I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be something for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matching shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest and hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
.. to the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely


There are times.. when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you, and me


Yo, yo, check it
It's important, we communicate
And tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understanding and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family- love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine




Yeah.. yo, yo, check it
It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to, thinking you fresh
Suggesting beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard trying to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'mma lead you
Andwhatever's right, I'mma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

Keep 'em high

Is in the pocket like wallets,I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it,I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
'Til I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said I'se a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow
My heart, and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash your skull
And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't, usually smoke

N-n-n-n-n-now who the hell is this
E-mailing me at 11:26?
Telling me that she 36-26, plus double-d
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now she just lamping, chilling on campus
Sent me a picture of her feelin' on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T-E, it's getting late mami
Your screen saver say tweet, so you got to ""call me""
And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli
(You mean Talib? Lyrics sticks to your rib)
I mean(That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)
I mean (You don't really know him, why is you lyin')
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time
And get her high


Yo, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes
But never mind,I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow,you trying to blow backs out
Well okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm
Ayo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?
And sister's the bomb,boy she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a okay playa hater
Anyway, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much or trying to get off cigarettes?
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
Now I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubba kush and a sister could get a hit of it


Get 'em high like noonor the moon
Or a room filled with smoke,a hype filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the noteswith real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote
Control rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs, it's like Tiger
Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show,called Soul Survivor
I stole on liver, niggas than you
You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me
They say Hip-Hop is dead,I'm here to resurrect me
Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come, you the hot garbage of
The year's clear your image and snooped up
Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga
Read the infra-red across your head,I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver,I ain't a Madd Rapper
Just an emcee with a temper
You dancing for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wiresand fires, emcees retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then

Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon
Formed against, yes glory is destined
Every day women and men become legends
Sins that go against our skin become blessings

Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin' us
Justice for all just ain't specific enough
One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
True and livin' livin' in us,resistance is us
That's why Rosa sat on the bus
That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up
When it go down we woman and man up
They say, ""Stay down"", and we stand up

Enemy is lethal,a king became regal
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle
The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history
No one can win the war individually
It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy
Welcome to the story we call victory
The comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the glory


One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours

I met this girl, when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school, when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic checkin' her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas, had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out and listen to her
Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
Cause we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh yo, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister
Boy I tell ya, I miss her




Now periodically I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
About my people she was teachin' me,by not preaching to me
But speaking to mein a method that was leisurely
So easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool
Cause around the same time,I went away to school
And I'm a man of expanding, so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did stud, she got big pubbut what was foul
She said that the pro-black, was going out of style
She said, Afrocentricity, was of the past
So she got into R&amp;B,hip-house,bass,and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty; she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becoming well rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just having fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung




I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money,and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, looking rock and dressin' hippie
And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city
Talking about popping Glocks serving rocks and hittin' switches
Now she's a gangsta rolling with gangsta bitches
Always smoking blunts and getting drunk
Telling me sad stories,now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin' how hardcore and ""real"" she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed (giiirl, he's committed), but so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same letting all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin' her,and taking her to the sewer
But I'ma take her back hoping that the shit stop
Cause who I'm talking 'bout, y'all, is hip-hop

Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep cause on the real he had five kids
Live nig's, real niggas express and taste it
At crap games, black dames and big faces
Cases in court, fam' showing love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport

Like a story that he don't want to end

It's all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love, hoping it'd become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Trying to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave
Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave
Funny,we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?
Everybody loves sun, why do I attract shade?
Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
What it is to be loved by a man




Some say that I'm a dreamer cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in, fall in it
With the right companion we all in it
Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
In the game of life,it's the scrimmage
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days

This is common
Shout outs to No I.D
Shout outs to Chicago
Good music
Yeah what up, what up ye, love
Yo,this is my sixteen bars

Feed live souls with two fish and five loaves
Teach a man to cook it for survival
My dad said it rained on my arrival
Not a storm of the brain makes these niggas drive slow
Like I was five-O but my creeds Apollo
On a rocky road with Dakota's live show
For those before I came I make the song cry for
Lyrical gymnast, you set the bar low
This is that, Kilimanjaro, like twitter you can follow
It may be hard to read like hiero, glyphics
Written on the walls of Cairo
Check my youth revival, truth inside flow
I stand like M there with dato
Crash party any live ho is liable to get banged like gangs that rival, tribal slang
From the primal brain kill the game and watch it die slow

Yo, just relax, take it easy slow down
I had this, I had this friend of mine
Who just, you know, he was moving too fast, you known I'm saying?
I told him to slow down, he said the sun don't chill
I said, I said still, I said still, you gotta
Just appreciate life, sit back, don't let it fly right past you
No matter what go on I'm still gettin mine
No matter the year, no matter the place, no matter the time


Check it
It's like I'm fighting for freedom, writing for freedom
These record company niggas I don't like when I see 'em
My ancestors, when I'm writing I see 'em and talk with 'em
Hoping in the promise land I can walk with 'em
Shitted on so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall with 'em
Molest concepts,stalk rhythms,paid dues, bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call
Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall
MCs reckless eyeball, why y'all wanna go and do that?
Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't theU-Ac
No mo', still together
Like in the ghettophoto with one nigga in the chair
Holding liquor in despair,gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say I'm nice with metaphors but these are similes
Street ministry,my poetry's a penitentiary, track is visitation
Sentences is life,I'm like chief up in this demonstration
Still...




You squirm with discomfort, wiggle and cough
Six days of madness and you might throw me off
On this great ball of stress that they call the earth
I'mma show y'all in rhyme just how much shit I been through
And all the places I went to, always played the low
It's like a competition, this mission here I'm telling you
Slip up and rhyme-ass niggas here is felling you
Crash courses, slow down you can't learn that quick
Cause I'm the dead eye,with the red eye, fromChi to L-I
I thought y'all knew, every year I grew, I'm still growing
And in a year or two I hope my girl'll be showing
A male seed,praise God I name him Moses
I lead people I want him to, that's why I chose this
Now is the glass half-full or half-empty
Common, why they tempt me
Theking of the simply, bore in mic
I always stay on top cause I give niggas what they like
I know y'all hate that why I feel I owe y'all everyday
If y'all hear it a thousand times, it's gon' be the same way
The 'Dat-Father, go farther, why bother
Now I'm a peaceful man, I don't want no stress
You know I'm still...




Yo yo, some get Range Rovers, some religion change-over
Angel on my main shoulder telling me remain sober
Token nigga, game's over ain't no payola in freestyle
In battles, I'm warring like a G-Child
Searching for the child in me, this style in me
This release is like the piece that's now in me
They tried to 'sassinate me god, like Martin on the balcony
Lyrically I put a hit on 'em, cause I'm the style ""Nitti""
Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty
Trying to get a chick to kick it with metill the tilt
Told her my chamber's like Wilt
Built with her for a sec, let her know I had respect
Less than a hour she was giving me neck, yo I'm still getting mine

Gluttony, baby
To me, it's what I see
Gluttony, baby
Is us, it's hard to see


It sit deep in my chest, so let me express
Grew up on 868, oh, y‰Ûªall don‰Ûªt need the address
It was ‰Û÷round CVS, we were so devious
The city never sleeps, it be needing some rest
The streets was a mess, and they still are
Feel our pain, the bigger picture, we was all framed
But the game is the game, so let it begin
In these streets, these are the

Now, the first is pride, though some call it vanity
A hustler's insanity can break up the family
Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change
Knowing that he'll end up in a grave
It's the arrogance, they say, in us Americans
Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting

Like the second is something we all have
Or felt, than Cain or Khan, it's called wrath
I seen a boss take it out on his staff
Seen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath
Never seen a man making money while he mad
So hustle plus wrath? Y'all do the math

Now the third, you probably heard from MOP
They say use them rocks to make 'em envy
Envy, the cousin of jealousy,on the streets it's a felony
When niggas fucking hit you up [?] fidelity
They hate it, to see you celebrated
Counting my paper, nigga, you could have made it

Let me stay with that thought, takes us to the fourth
Where niggas is lazy, that's what we call sloth
Want you to break em off, getting money it costs
For you to be a boss, ain't no taking off

Now the myth about the fifth: it only happens when we eat
It‰Ûªs gluttony, this is how it happens on the street
It‰Ûªs a dude that‰Ûªs getting paid in full, cars and jewels
So his plate is full, but the way this nigga move
He is never full and he gon want your food
Don't overdo it, that's an underrated rule

The sixth is a fix that's in all of us
When I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust
When the drawers go down, the guards go down
Cause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now

Okay, the seventh is a seed that many believe
Is the cause of em all, this is what we call greed
Knew some cousins that was hustlin', one of em ended up bustin' the other
Greed is a mother, it‰Ûªs greedy motherfuckers like Madoff
Cops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off

Before I sign off, in the sins we livin'
The good thing is we can be forgiven

It was once said by Black Thought that things fall apart
Knew I shouldn't have been messin with dude's girl from start
But I pimp from the heart, the art of it made it interestin
Plus me and sister blend before we got intimate
Friend or no friend, my man caught wind
This chick is payin me, it'll either cost me or cost him
Told her she shoulda lost him (when?) a while ago
Cause dude'll drink a pile of Mo' and defile heryo
I ain't here to start on this [nigga]for me to wreck his broad
You could tell what I thought of this [nigga]
Nickname was Smoke, don't know if that was cause of cigarettes
(or what?) or guns he tote,he called shots on the deck

'round four, when she was comin she would beep me
I sat deep in the corner,drinkin zombies, becomin one by now
Wonderin if my style would support her and her child
Out the corner of my eye saw this stud I recognized (who?)

Told Jill Scott to meet we coulda picked a better spot

But he was on the horn informin the rest of them hoodlums(aight)
Usually I wouldn't fight over a woman, old girl had a sun-shine
Was messed up, on Smoke's payroll was one-time
My pager went off, it read one line:""Come get me
From Halsted,""I'm thinkin this is monkey bar [shit]
Went to the phone quick, called her (what happened?) Her line was busy
Situation number nine,got my mind dizzy
Wondered if this plan was designed to get me
I've been drinkin too strong to be thinkin too long

The anticipation arose as time froze
I stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
Into the deep cosmos
The impact pushed back, the first five rows
But before the raw live shows
I remember I's a little snot-nosed
Rocking Cazal goggles and Izod clothes
Learning the ropes of ghetto survival
Peeping out the situation I had to slide through
Had to watch my back, my front, plus my sides too
When it came to getting mine I ain't trying, to argue
Sometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you
Hip-hop, you the love of my life and that's true
When I was handling the shit I had to do
It was all for you, from the door for you
Speak through you, getting paper on tour for you
From the start, Thought was down by law for you
Used to hit up every corner store wall for you
We ripped shit and kept it hardcore for you
I remember late nights, steady rocking the mic
Hip-hop you the love of my life
So tell the people like that y'all
And it sounds so nice

I was speaking, to my guy 'Riq and
How she was desperately seeking to Organize in a Konfusion
Using no protection, told H.E.R. on Resurrection
Caught up in the Hype Williams,and lost H.E.R. direction
Getting ate in sections where I wouldn't eat H.E.R
An under the counter love, so silently I treat H.E.R
Her Daddy'll beat H.E.R., eyes all Puff-ed
In the mix on tape, niggas had her in the buff
When we touch, it was more than just afuck
The Police
In H.E.R. I found peace
Like Malcolm in the East
Seen H.E.R. on the streets of New York, tricking off
Tried to make a hit with H.E.R. but my dick went soft
Movin weight, losing weight
Not picky with who she choose to date
To confuse the hate with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty
Most of the niggas she know is dirty
Having more babies than Lauryn
She started showing early
As of late I realized, that this is H.E.R. fate
Or destiny that brings the best of me
It's like God is testing me
In retrospect I see she brought lifeand death to me
Peace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform
It's just coffee shop chicks and White dudes
Over H.E.R. I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube
Now the fight moved to in life, making the right moves
Besides God and family, you my life's jewel

My dream is to be...
My dream is to be...
My dream is to be free


In search of brighter days, I ride through the maze of the madness
Struggle is my address, where pain and crack lives
Gunshots coming from sounds of blackness
Given this game with no time to practice
Born on the black list, told I'm below average
A life with no cabbage
That's no money if you from where I'm from
Funny,I just want some of your sun
Dark clouds seem to follow me
Alcohol that my pops swallowed bottled me, no apology
I walk with a boulder on my shoulder
It's a cold war, I'm a colder soldier
Hold the same fight that made Martin Luther the King
I ain't using it for the right thing
In between lean and the fiends, hustle and the schemes
I put together pieces of a dream, I still have one






The world see me lookin' in the mirror
Images of me, gettin' much clearer
Dear self, I wrote a letter just to better my soul
If I don't express, then forever I hold
Inside,I'm from the side where we out of control
Rap music in the hood play the fatherly role
My story like yours, yo it gotta be told
Tryna make it from a gangsta to a godlier role
Where it scrolls and stow slaves,and Jewish people in cold cage
Hate has no color or age
Flip the page, now my race became freedom
Write dreams in the dark, they far but I can see 'em
I believe in heaven more than hell, lessons more than jail
In the ghetto, let love prevailwith a story to tell
My eyes see the glory, and well
The world waiting for me to yell ""I Have a Dream""

You know, they call me a pimp, and you know what that mean
I'm a Person that's Making Profit.See I pimp internationally
I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted
I pimp with the truth, that's the only method


Seen her on Madison where Vice Lords be Travelin
And Chevy windows be rattlin
And badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts
Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched
Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig
Asked her the name, one way to approach her
See she had game, she needed me to coach her
Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture
The way a righteous pimp is supposed to


As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune
I ain't having it like abortion
Walking with this stick holding his tip
Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp
It was cold as shit, I'm waitin on my ride
Act like I didn't see him I tried


Motion denied(pause)
I felt the vibe like Roy Ayers
She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators
Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure
That's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand

Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya

Make your next move your best move, choose me


How I look working for a nigga in a kufi
If I was on a track you couldn't produce me
With them shits on your wrist looking goofy


(yea ok)
I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel
You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level
You used to the same game, cats saying the same thang
Nigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream


Nigga you must not know of me
I'm the mack here
Ought to have you ho for me(Common: get real now)
Pimp yo punk ass
Have you write me poetry
I'm from a lane called cash
You too slow for me


You know why?
I'm thinking bigger than Bagets
Birds in slick cars
Or have you on the corner trickin in strip bars
If you become mine the world would be ours
Respect the game, and universal laws


What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall

Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball
I know pimpin ain't easybutdamn you barely surviving
We can't ride together cause you ain't driving

You and I together is like Ashford and Simpson

I got my own stable (Common: where at)
I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track
Matter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract


Girl you getting beside yourself
I'm trying to guide you
Help you see inside yourself
I pimp with vision, I'm a help you see the light
Have you covering your body and have you eating right

Pimp rhythms, pimp flows
Pimp men (Common: and pimp what)

I get six hundred off yo' skinny ass weekly
You'll get all them righteous hoes in that dashiki


Yo, what ever happened to loyalty
Don't you want to become royalty
On the streets selling ass and oils for me
But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you
Fuckyou then I'm about to be a preacher



Well there you have it ya'll

Yo, yo.. (all night long)


During divine hours, I use mind power to refine
Flower girls, and make 'em feel like black pearls
Get they minds off acryllic nails and the rap world
It's a lot you can find in the lost black girl
Made signs built in lodges, we be in garages
Discussin' who we boned and who God is
Pro-black like Craig Hodges with my dashikis in the cleaners
I kick it for the Chevy ridin' head to backstreet leaners

Check it, check it
I was born underwater with three dollars and a cocktail
Tryna make the Garden of Eden, out of Auckdale and Rockwell
Locked in this Grid like a 2Pac tale
While her-on rock smells make the cops tail
My third eye is my rail, on this L of thought
With afrocentric stamps I'm mailin' thoughts to my Gods held in court
I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk
I try to walk like an Egyptian, but Hieroglyphics fail to talk
I guess the hustlin is the unspoken Gospel
Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago
E Bottom, here's the bottle
I think I, need a cup of a tea, because I'm novel
(come on bay-bayyy) Bust it


Iahhhhh jus' wanna rock you

A portrait of the Artist,formerly known as Sense
The brain-wash, with my vocal tones I rinses
Opportunity and the beat knocks
Women, give me rhythm like beatbox,but it's the year
Of completion, I want a Queen to complete Rash'
Who's flavored from stacks, to Reeboks
Send blessings to the family of Ice Mike
Shit like that, don't help me write right, but I got site/sight
Like a destruction worker, when it's time to build
Get off like Sam Jack' and it's time to kill
In perseverence I'mma find a meal, and provoke
My Gramps used to trick off big papers at the Riverboat

I walk downtown to tempos and never lose the beat
Some people got ignorance confused with bein' street
On the, street of desire my body and soul meet
Arguin over thick broads and meals with no meat
Had the cold feet for a second
Mega-niggas in my box throwin suggestions
Had me checkin' myself and double checkin', I popped the resurrection
In the mirror I only heard my reflection
Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections
And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections
I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents
Outspoken like 30's but yet I guard my lips
Writin niggas with stripes, I hold posture with
Poppin shit to fat broads, wearin os-trich
Givin em voicemail, tracks are like County
To them I voice-jail/gel, if you believe in Heaven
Why is the choice Hell? Why is this choice Hell?
Why is this choice Hell?


Iahhhhh jus' wanna rock you
Alllllll night looooong, oahhhhohhh (keep goin)
Iahhhhh jus' wanna rock you (keep goin, keep goin, keep on)

Ooahhhoahhhhh (ah keep on, ah keep.. ah don't you give up)

Then I lay low, looking for the halo
Or more yayo, my little angel
Reminded me to stay playful
Faithful walks I take in the woods
Thinking whats good, things that I can change I should
Things I can't, need to be understood
Th-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood
For a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace
Pipes that Indians used to light, we called it Chief, right?
Stepping on the leafs right, to reach heights
Th-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen
Some use it for medicine, or to write better things
I was in Amsterdam man, bike pedalling
To the nature spot to taste the flavours they got
My eyes drop, I like it a lot
Yeah, my angel


I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)


Th-th-the way that I rhyme, blow nigga's mind
Like the first time you heard Mary J and you were standing in line
To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind
And I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen
And like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple
Rockin every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael
That made me feel like I could fly,sometimes I wanted to die
Prolly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
So I start hip-hop and I understand whyCommon used to love her
She got me open so I even had to fuck her
But I used the rubber, cause she was married to Rakim
So I bought me a gold chain, pretendin' that I was him
So I can get close to the girl I loved the most
But she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost
Big gave her one more chance, and she took Big down
I should've knew it, Shock G and Pac told me ""She get around"", an angel




Fly away, fly away
My love for her is not about jewelry and cars
I love her cause she love me, just for who I are
Who I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'
I shine like Shynewhen Barrington Levy was sayin, ""Didilly whoooa!""
I got love for the streets, peace to New York and every hood in the East
Before I was duckin' cops, gunshots,I used to be an L.A. Dodger, now I'm a (Angel)
From the city of lost souls,Impalas and polished gold
Between the car, and the rims, we got a lot of chrome
Your hood not alone, they knockin, we not at home
And when they bust in,we not Caesar, but gotta roam
Cause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones
The ones they put wires on, they got us on tap
But I put wires on, my Bentley in fact
I spit it through the wires on a Kanye track




Yeah, it's The Game and Common
Spread your wings, follow your dreams
Things will be so serene, L.A. and the Chi is a team
Yeah, angel supreme
Yeah, keep on
Yeah, it's for the world boy, we do it forever, yeah",rap,,,,Common,Announcement (Ft. Pharrell Williams) prod. by The Neptunes,http://genius.com/Common-announcement-lyrics,"I'm finna take you to the tip-top, baby


Everybody, I'd like to announce
Throw your hands up when we in the house
Yeah, this is hip hop, baby
I'm finna take you to the tip-top, baby
And tell your girl that the tickets is out
And we gonna do this 'til they kickin' us out
Cause, this is hip hop, baby
I'm finna take you to the tip-top, baby


Live from the south side, this one,hide your gun
Representing Chi Town to the fullest,raps are bullets
See them rappers? They be duckin'
When Comm be buckin' in the kitchen, fuckin'
On the sink,got my momma a mink
Think Common is the link
Thought the game was extinct
Lady, them jeans is as slim as Shady
Brought them back from the 80's
Now, let's make some babies
Freestyle paid offso Lincoln paid me
Now we can push more whips than slavery
Alex Haley of this rap shit, my roots is deep
You heard the bitch in you, yeah I know what's beef
Let it cook and I pop like grease
You thirsty niggas can't shock my feast, ugh
I still love her, she be needin' the dick
When it comes to hip-hop, it's just me and my bitch




Baby,you're like, ""What the-- fuck? There is no other""
Valet crashed my Rolls so quickly I bought another
Sorry, Mr. Williams moved out the building
Spot to the top, 50 feet was the ceiling
(Slow down, son, you're killin' 'em)Well funded it was not gangsta
Came to shitty deals, reminiscing gives me chills
When Puff was with Biggie, Versace on every niggie
The backpacker copped the Porsche and drove through his city
Now, all the little bitties, from ugly to pretty
I was the magician, mesmerize 'em, made 'em listen
My dick is like a blow-pop baby
And it get stiffer than some Botox baby
But show out baby, and show me you gon' act right
And I'll be pedaling backwards like a track bike
She don't know the Casio cost a hundred
It's been two years since I done it, now all the rappers want it
What?




As I sit back, relax with Chicago on my back
Unzip the backpack, pull out a fifth of 'gnac
I probably go to jail but naw, that ain't me
I style crazy and net like Jay Z
The black Kojak""I get money"" and want more stacks
The rap photographer, the way the flow snap
Broads say, ""Are you a philosopher?""
Yea yea, I'll philosophize on top of ya

As precious as my rhyme is I keep them all anonymous
To purify my essences eliminate the rivalry
Cause they hurting me.I give them all of everything
The love with no condition and they stealing trying
To rob me For that I give them props
Cause I give them all a lot
They thinking that my kindness will manipulate my weakness
Then I give you all a warrantee I guarantee you flop
Benefit of Doubts is only good for so long I validate improvements

I got a chip on my shoulder
True players always maintain, I'm different I told ya
Don't want to be just a commodity
I'm smarter G
This is my life, and my soul not just a job to me
It's the truest part of me
Fans now mobbing me
Fake friends acting like I just won the lottery
Back then I guess it was hard to see
The real paradox
What an odyssey
It's like that saying
Be careful what you pray for you might get it
Of course it's all about winning and money but how far would one let it
Taken 'em, the holy game can make 'em, then instantaneously break 'em
Rain one day sunshine the next
Haters try to stop my flow sometimes I'm vexed
What's next hounded by the press
Mad stress on my chest
Of course I know that I'm blessed but here's the test
On ""Any Given Sunday"" I got to play my best


Sacrifice don't give up the fight
Everything will be all right on any given Sunday
Guru: The harder they come, yeah the harder they must fall
Depends on you if you win or lose
You know you got to pay some dues so that you can live on Monday
Guru: Strive to achieve and die for what you believe


On the battlefields left abandoned
One man standing
To me the ball was handed
Taken shots and left stranded
No defense so they tackle me
Every blow brings back a memory
Learning lessons from my injury
It's killing me
Cause at first they wasn't feeling me
Never given a chance to show my true ability
Too many pressures trying to play me out
Put me in positions that's sure to lay me out
No doubt




Playing on a field of hard times
These struggles like the yard line that I gain from
Nowhere is where I came from
From day one, I knew the game and how to play run
But never knew the price of fame would weigh tons
Now I learn from self when pain comes
And walk when they say run
Fame could be as painful as theDeath of Payton
Young black, gifted
But I'm wrapped in myself
Done broke many tackles but I'm trapped in myself
See what happens with wealth
At times you can lose yourself
During the sunniest of days many superstars melt
From cotton to football fields
You know how they play brothers
Long as we playing well they love us
I know on Any Given Sunday
This can be taken from me
What it all comes down to is money
I know on Any Given Sunday
This could be taken from me
What it all comes down to is money y'all

Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifthteens of the jeep that you boom
Son so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Oshun hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building I'm the doorman, opening doors
My blood I expose on the floors,tell them the game ain't only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds
Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine

To purify the world (du-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba)

Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks
With raps, all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous, where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy yo remain yourself
They say im slept on, now im bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of fiends, I flow over water thats as troubled as teens
For the love of the team, trying to double the dream
Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings
Im rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The black human genius will never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth, sent to replinish the Earth
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to godsfrom bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first

In the Spirit of the Ancestors
In the Spiritof theBlack Panthers
In the Spirit of Assata Shakur
We make thismovement towards freedom
For all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle
Yeah. yo, check it-


There were lights and sirens, gunshots firing
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice with her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, trying to hold on
To life.She thought she'd live with no arm
That's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room-she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
""Who shot the trooper?"" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger, survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was building as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this German nurse they would've served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me?
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it, y'all


I'm thinking of Assata, yes
Listen to my love, Assata, yes
Your power and pride is beautiful
May God bless your soul


It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies crackling, I see them when they're taking her
Though she kind of knew
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middlesex Prison about 6 in the morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
A cell, one cot, no window, facing hell
Put in the basement of a prison with all males
And the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, paint, and begin to read
Two years in a hole, her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her, hoping she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she'd bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it, people




Yo, from North Carolina her grandmother would bring
News that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in their old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldn't of done
Medical evidence shown she couldn't have shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this beautiful woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But she's free with political asylum in Cuba


I‰Ûªm thinking of Assata, yeah
Listen to my love, Assata, yeah
We‰Ûªre molded from the same mud, Assata
We share the same blood, Assata, yeah
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul
Your power and pride, so beautiful
May God bless your soul


Freedom? You're asking me about freedom? You're asking me about freedom? I'll be honest with you. I know a whole more about what freedom isn't than about what it is, because I've never been free.I can only share my vision with you of the future, about what freedom is

There's liquor stores, beauty supplies and rap songs
I travel the world just to come back to it
The crib got a lot of soul like black music
I'm attached to it, in many ways this city raised me
And gave me the drama, honor and bravery
The streets seem hollow, when I go to Chicago
It's cheap wine and sorrow, times is hard to swallow
In search of God's tomorrow, I borrow
Words from the Bible, and use them for survival
Gangs rival, signs painted on walls like hiero-glyphics
I tell them that this is all tribal
Used to do dirt, shorty's goin through the same cycle
And trials like Michael, tryin not to stay idle - back home




Back home, it's not Compton but close, the same problems exist
And the pain throbbin and folks are so common
It don't, really bother us much, we just swallow it
Uh, crack the bottle and smoke
Hope tomorrow somethin magical happens that'll put me back in the biz
But the chances of it actually happening's kinda slim
Back home, we get the good life at a glimpse
In the form of a rap star, drug dealers and pimps
I'm back, home


Back, home - I try my best to keep it together
It's cold, like the Windy City streets of December
I pace back and forth, lookin for the courage to shine
But can't tap the source, need somethin to nourish my mind
I know we all lose quite a bit in life, only to gain some
Life or the dark winding roads we came from
But I move with the night so I'm used to the shade
And never lose sight, bringin truth back to the game


Back, home - we've got a lot of shit on our minds
We're always behind on somethin cause there's not enough time
And we're non-stop, bottom line, doin what we gotta do
To get some food in the fridge and stay out of the hospital
Back home there's people callin us hopeless
People tryin to tell us all we need is some focus
But, focus, focus is overrated
Cause you see every blemish and mistake and can't change it
Back home is Alvarado, K-Town and J-Town
Or Little Tokyo for those that don't know
Where figures shiver, livin right in the litter
Where kids write bigger, right inside the L.A. river
On the concrete, a symbol of our everyday way
It's that color and concentration over heavy and gray
And by the time the ink dries on this page
I'll be half a day away from the place where I stay (yeah)




We takin it back home y'all
Yeah, it's Common Sense (yeah)
My guy Mike (what up Com'?)
S.O.B. (uh-huh) yeah
This time we rotate, it's good music (ha ha ha)
Hip-Hop (it don't stop) yeah, uhh

My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices

I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd and Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog""
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits

Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
Cause that implies that we back from something
If we back from something there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I couldn't give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left

My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay mom mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled

And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori

From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way, to Sacramento, late night, Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drank in my mouth

I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man could change the world
That one man could change the world


All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But its hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my step brother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like, ""Ain't too much that's different""
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up everyday like you on a mission?


And I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing, one man could change the world
One man could change the world


My grandma told me, ""If you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white out""
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive; went to war, came back alive?
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black you had to extra-extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive,and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise sayin'...


I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man can change the world
That one man can change the world

As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles

Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands


The best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm about to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get
Ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so yeah I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said
""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your #1 your #2 now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit them with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gonna do now?
Whatever I want to do. Gosh! It's cool now""
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya,stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles
I kill the block, I murder the avenues
I rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Trying to draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up


Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands


Pull up in the monster automobile, gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
OK, first things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'm a start rocking gold teeth and fangs
Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan that's the monster do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbiez got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki cause she's fake
She's on a diet but her pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am should mÌ©nage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give them whiplash
I think big, get cash, make them blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
I'm a motherfucking monster


I crossed the limelight

She take my money, when I'm in need
Yeah she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger, way over town
That digs on me


(She give me money)Now I ain't saying she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messing with no broke niggas
(She give me money)Now I ain't saying she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messing with nobroke niggas
(I gotta leave)Get down girl, go 'head, get down


Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you rock,I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm and your arm
But I'm looking for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez,four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to showbiz?
Ok, get your kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fucking with this girl then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she use to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her




18 years, 18 years
She got one of your kids, got you for 18 years
I know somebody paying child support for one of his kids
His baby momma's car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money
She walking around looking like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk, holla, ""We want prenup!""
""We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)
It's something that you need to have
Cause when she leave your ass she gonna leave with half
18 years, 18 years
And on the 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his?!




Now I ain't saying you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washingwatch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition baby look in his eyes
This week he mopping floors next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes balling and yeah that's nice
And they gonna keep calling and trying but you stay right girl
And when you get on he leave your ass for a white girl

If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me

Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life

Zane Lowe),http://genius.com/Kanye-west-2013-zane-lowe-bbc-radio-interview-part-1-annotated,"Zane Lowe:Grab a seat, grab a seat. So, you remember this place??I was also thinking about some of the other things we've done as well with the BBC, likeAbbey Road sprung to mind with the strings.

Kanye West: Oh yeah. That was good.That suit was like, I would've worn something different if I could look back right now.I could still do a suit, I just wouldn't have done that exact lapel situation.

ZL: But talk about really putting yourself on the line with that.That was so early on for you to be stepping in a room with that many players and to give yourself that objective.What are your thoughts when you think back about Abbey Road, where...it's just nuts.

KW: I thought it was good. I thought it was what I was supposed to do at that time.If I see something, if I see an opportunity, I'm gonna go for it.We're all gonna die one day.

ZL: Yeah, that's true.

KW:So live like that. Live like you could die tomorrow. Go for it.Those steps have been the platforms that allowed me to make it this far.

ZL: And you have, man, and you're here.Six original albums of your own,a Throne record,various records with G.O.O.D. Musicto talk about. But seriously, man,. Bravo, dude. I mean, that is one of the most creative records of any genre I've heard in a very, very long time, and just in terms of your output, your most exciting-sounding record, I think.

KW: Oh, thank you very much. Yeah, I feel I was able to start making exactly what was in my mind again, not having to speak with the textures of the time. Cause, you know,is definitely Kanye West,and there's something weird and kind of off about ""Mercy,"" like when it has the high-pitched (impersonates noise), that type of sound. It sounds like art still a little bit, even though it obviously was a radio smash.

But when I get into the idea, the trap drums and things like that, certain songs that are blatant radio hits, it's like I'm speaking with today's textures. If you look at it 200 years from now, it's not going to stand out in the way thatorstands out, and can completely push or redefine or make people say, hey, I completely hate that, or I completely love that, but let me just think differently. Becauseeverybody is bound to these -- no pun intended-- they're boundsixteen bars or eight bars, andthe normal radio thing.

I was talking to Frank Ocean about this, and said,my mom got arrested for the sit-ins,and now we're more like the sit-outs.Like, sit off of radio, and say, hey radio, come to.We need to find something new, because it's being controlled in a way, and manufactured in a way,that really awesome artists can make amazing music and not break as far past as, like, something that's very formulaic.

ZL: So it almost feels like a duty to you in a weird way? Having the peoples' ear, having peoples' attention for great music, to be able to say, well, if I'm not challenging them enough, I'm not challenging myself, not challenging radio, what am I doing?

KW: Yeah. I'm not trying to regurgitate myself.I showed people that I understand how to make perfect.could be considered to be perfect.I know how to make perfect.But that's not what I'm here to do. I'm here to crack the pavement and make new grounds, sonically and society, culturally.

ZL: You've done that with. It's fascinating for us to sit here and talk about this record now, because normally when I talk to artists about records of this nature, it's in the lead-up to something. So we're all kind of playing a guessing game, you know what I mean? You could tell me what you think of the record, but I'm trying to find my way around it, the audience probably won't have heard it. In this case, it's been out for a minute, so we can reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight, too. You've seen what everyone else has had to say about this record, both good and bad. But I'm fascinated to know, today, howwould describe, as someone who made it. How you would describe that record.

KW: I just think that I'm a production person, I'm a product guy, I'm a producer. So if I'm working on a John Legend album, I'm gonna try to give John Legend the best home for him to stay in.And I'm gonna try to push Pusha T -- no pun intended once again,this keeps happening to me-- to make the thing that represents what I like about his music the most.And then for me as Kanye West, I gotta fuck shit up.

ZL:And you did, dude, seriously. From the minute it starts. I mean, seriously. (Plays opening to ""On Sight"").It's disgusting.

So you're up in the loft probably at this point, and you're kicking around ideas, and you're putting things together, and this sound comes into your head, and you're like, this is what I'm looking for?

KW:Nah. This is me going to the studio with Thomas and Guy-Manuel, who's Daft Punk.They had a synthesizer the size of that wall right there.This is just one session right here. This beat was originally like 14 minutes long, and that part in the beginning was something we completely just distorted, and I ended up making that the intro.

ZL: You know,I got a beef with you over this track. It's too short! I wanted more out of it.Cause it's one of the best beats on the record for me, and it feels like you're just getting warmed up. Was that kind of deliberate, to pull back after only a couple of verses and go, you know what, we're going to get on with the album now?

KW: Nah, it's just what I felt, like it should be.

ZL: Just a dance thing.

KW: And you know, originally ""Blood on the Leaves"" was supposed to be first.

ZL: Wow.

KW: Which, psychologically, I know would have changed certainnaysayersabout the album.It wasn't that time for me. I didn't want to come up there and perform. A lot of times, music can be presented as a service position.But I wanted to take a more aggressive approach with music.

You know, people go on a vacation and say, you got the drugs, you got the music, you got the wine?It's in that territory. But I wanted to speak up and say, okay, so my voice is only compressed to express myself artistically through music. It's the only place where I actually have a deal, so I can only consistently make things in music.So I'm gonna take music and I'm gonna try to make it three-dimensional, like onand the hologram'll pop up out of R2D2.I'm gonna try to make something that jumps up and affects you, in a good or bad way.Whether it's,I'm going into a scream in the middle of the track because that's just the way I feel.But I'm not here to make easy listening, easy programmable music.

ZL: No. You're so off the reservation on this album in the best possible way. Like you talked about, the way you use your voice in different ways, you don't rely on conventional rhyming flows. Your opening line, ""Yeezus season approaching,"" you know? ""A monster's awoken."" You're laying it out there, this isn'tpart 2. I'm wilding out on this record, straight away.

(Plays interlude from ""On Sight""). And then from nowhere as well, we just get treated to these wonderful moments where, like you say, it's almost like a collage. Like you're sitting here going, you know, whyI go into this? Why not?

KW: You can.

ZL: And you did.

KW: That's how life is. It's like a car crash. You could just be driving, and just out of nowhere it happens.

ZL: At what point did that very deliberate feel to the record, whereby breaks come in and join this really discordant electronic moments and everything seems to exist in this very contradictory but it works kind of way, at what point did that start to take shape? Because it is very omnipresent through the record as a whole, the way it flips between one and the other. Was that in your head early on, or did that come towards the end when you started to reduce the record?

KW:Well, I didn't reduce it. Rick Rubin reduced it. He's not a producer, he's a reducer. (Laughs).

ZL: But was it always part of the process for you, to say, why don't I take elements of this and this and just (claps hands together) bolt it together?

KW: Yeah. It's just the way I was consuming information in my life at the time. Negative information to positive information, from the Internet, just going to the Louvre, going to furniture exhibits and understanding that, trying to open up and do interviews like this, learning more about architecture.Taking one thousand meetings, attempting to get backing to do clothing and different things like that. Getting no headway whatsoever. It was just that level of frustration.This is what frustration fucking sounds like.

This is what frustration sounds like. For me, as Kanye West, I would not be Kanye West if it wasn't for Michael Jackson.I was with Quincy Jonesa couple days ago atJohn Legend's wedding. Quincy was telling me, it wasn't just Mike, but these guys broke down the barriers.Of course you know Michael Jackson, he had to fight to get his video played because he was black. This is. Michael Jackson's not even black, he's Michael Jackson -- you know what I mean?He's so crazy, how can he even be classified as this black artist?

So for me, in my life and creativity it's been challenging and everything. But I was able to ascend to massive heights because of the foundation that my mother and my father and my grandfather laid through civil rights, what Michael Jackson did with music videos and the ground he broke. There would be no Kanye West if it wasn't for Michael Jackson - that allowed him to be that, right?

Now let's take people who have issues with me as Kanye West.They classify my motivational speeches as rants- like ""Why is he saying that? Why is he doing that?"" WellI've reached a point in my life where my Truman Show boat has hit the painting. And I've got to a point that Michael Jackson did not break down. I have reached the glass ceiling - as a creative person, as a celebrity.

When I say that it means I want to do product. I am a product person. Not just clothing butwater bottle design, architecture, everything that you could think about. And I've been at it for 10 years, and I look around and I say, ""Hey wait a second - there's no one around here in this space that looks like me."" And if they are, they're quiet as fuck!

So that means - wait a second - now we're seriously in a Civil Rights movement. Like people used to joke about -remember our South Park photo - remember how funny that was?Do you think there would be a Givenchy in the hood if it wasn't for that South Park photo. But no one thinks about that - no one thinks about the names I got called for wearing tight jeans.

ZL: You reference that in the record, you talk about that. ""No one's liked him since he's been wearing tight jeans."" Everybody knows you brought back real rap. I mean you reference that in the record.

KW: I'm saying y'all had all that, but I brought real rap back. I'm going to do dope things. And I wanna take this opportunity to speak to something, because I go to Hypebeast sometimes to look at the new things that're coming out. And every time my name goes up, there's a series of people who write just negative comments - they wanna joke around and say, ""Why is he still trying? Why is he doing this?"" They like diss me as a person for trying. Now mind you, I've brought 10 years of product that has added to humanity.

And now, what they don't realize when I say ""Hey this is Pusha T, this is what it is"" I have to remind Pusha T that he's Pusha T. Because the radio, if they're not playing a song of his that has an R&amp;B hook on it or works at a certain level of trap tempo and plays in clubs, it's like we forget about that Clipse album that meant everything.

And the reason why I relate it to design and what we do in design is saying that's the music that us as creatives that wanted to get into design - we looked at Clipse as the gods, and this is our soundtrack to creativity. And it's not a trap beat that comes in on that soundtrack to creativity.No knock to trap, cause I did ""Can't Tell Me Nothing"" - I like it.But it's been commercialized to the point where - and I'm not mentioning no names - but people used to use the term ""R&amp;B nigga"" but then it was ""rappers."" But then rappers didn't wanna be no R&amp;B nigga. Now the rappers is the new R&amp;B niggas! The rapper's the new radio! Like where's the culture at? Where is the culture at?

So then I scream - and I'm sitting in the middle of it -whether I'm at a dinner with Anna Wintour, or I'm at a listening session with Pusha, or me and Virgil are in Rome giving designs to Fendiover and over and gettin' our designs knocked down.Brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no.How many motherfuckers you done seen with a leather jogging pant?Meaning when I see Hedi Slimane and it's all like, ""OK this is my take on the world"" - yeah he got some nice $5,000 jeans in there, some nice ones here and there, some good shit here and there.

But we culture. Rap the new rock n' roll! We culture!Rap is the new rock n' roll! We the rock stars!

ZL: It's been like that now for a minute.

KW:It's been like that for a minute, Hedi Slimane!It's been like that for a minute. We the real rock stars, and I'm the biggest of all of 'em.I'm the number one rock star on the planet.

Zane Lowe: There it is.That record- it says that. That's what your album says when you come out, and there are songs on there where you make it very clear.

KW: So what I want to explain to everybody out there, it's like, I make music I can do it,but I shouldn't be limited to only one place of creativity.And it's literally only like one of two reason why I haven't been able to break that down.

ZL: But why should you feel that you are? Because-

KW: No! This is the thing you guys don't understand. You guys don't understand.You guys don't understand that I did the Yeezys and they EBAY'd for 90 thousand dollars and people wanted them bad as whatever, right?But I didn't get a call from Nike the next day. You guys don't understand that I've met with companies and they say, ""What we're trying to figure out is how we can control you and control that"".If you're an architect and you're a world builder and you have all these ideas and you'reGaudi, and you want to build buildings, if you don't ever get that out, what's gonna happen?

ZL: Isn't that why you do it? Isn't it the process? Isn't it point to do it?

KW: I don't think you're really hearing what I'm saying.

ZL: I'm trying to

KW:As a creative, for you to have done something to the level of the Yeezys and not be able to create more and you cannot- you cannot create that on your own, with no support, with no backing.So when I say ""clean water was only served to the fairer skinned"" what I'm saying is we're making products with chitlins. T-SHIRTS! That's the most we can make! T-shirts. We could have our best perspective on t-shirts. But if it's anything else...
*HAND SMACK*
your Truman Show boat is hitting the wall.And what's more important to me about this than everything I can do sonically and everything is, if I go somewhere else and someone says, ""Hey, we don't like Kanye West"" you've heard that before, right?What people don't realize is I want to make uniforms for my high school basketball team through Brand Yeezy. I want to make that one step, and then make another step, and eventually do uniforms for the entire city, then I want those uniforms to be hot and make money, then I eventually want to be the anchor and the force behind a billion dollar company and after I make that billion dollar step, then I can go in and say I have an opinion on this and that could be a ten billion dollar step, I eventually want to be the anchor of the first trillion dollar company.But when you sit and you have a meeting with a company and show them the most innovate take on theatre because you thought of it one night when you were sitting on top ofWatch The Throne setwhich you designed with Es Devlin, andI designed the set with Es Devlinand thought of,""Ok, surround vision, there should be a screen above you, below you, to the left, to the right of you and one in front of you also""then I paid my own money that I get paid for doing Gold Digger, which I never really liked that song but I always knew I would get paid for doing Gold Digger,then I shoot a film in Qatar with three camera crews,with Nate Brown, Virgil, Matt Williams, Nabil, all of these crew- all of the people that every video that pops up every other day on Hypebeast thats my crew, right? So, we go out and shoot that, 3 camera crews over 5 days edited over 30 days, show it at amfAR- no,show it in Cannes, the night before amfAR on the beach, build it in a pyramid with Rem Koolhaas' agency, design the entire thing, put editors in it, blah blah blah, people give a standing ovation, I doan interview in New York Timesthe next year to say, ""Hey, I did this and I want to let you know I did it"", right? And then, it doesn't get mentioned in the interview and a week later they do an interview with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and they're talking about what the next frontier of theatre will be and how it'll be higher priced tickets and it'll be something that's surrounding you and blah blah blah, maybe it's in the goggles, I said, ""Wait a second, I just only did the interview to tell people that I invented it. I made it.""
Like I went, I remember when I was, uh, dropping William Morris, right, and then Sarah Newkirk at that time said ""Before you drop them, go meet with Ari Emanuel"" and I sat with him and I said, ""Ari, I'm an inventor"" and he goes on to tell me about the way it works and what he said was ""You are a celebrity. So basically what's going to happen is, there's product here, and this is where you end up, right here. If you can communicate the product you can make money of the product, cause look at Gaga. She's the Creative Director of Polaroid.""I like some the Gaga songs. What the fuck does she know about cameras?So it becomes all of this thing where all of the musicians-the musicians try to get more money by promoting other products, right? So you'll say ""Hey, you know what? I've got this water and we've got, you know, we've got this red version. We got a red bottle, and we've got a David Beckham version here, then we got a blue version."" So my opinion is no more than the patina on top of it, when I understand the reason from my core of why something should work all the way through. So, I understand we want to make it about music but I wanted to take this step to say, we got this new thing called ""Classism"". It's racism's cousin. This is what we do to hold people back. This is what we do. And we got this other thing we got that has been working for a long time where you don't have to be racist anymore it's called ""Self-Hate""; it works on itself. It's like real estate of racism. Where, just like that, when someone comes up and says something like""I am a god"", everybody says ""Who does he think he is?""I just told you who I thought I am, a god! I just told you! That's who I think I am! Would it have been better if I had a song that said, ""I am a nigga""?or if I had song that said ""I am a gangsta""? or if I had song that said ""I am a pimp""?All those color and patinas fit better on a person like me, right?But to say you are a god? Especially, when you got shipped over to the country that you're in, and your last name is a slave owners. How can you say that; how could you have that mentality?

ZL: I mean, I know in the past you've talked about, like, you know, building hotels, doing things beyond people's normal frame of reference. They know you as Kanye West, an artist. They know you're moving into fashion, but these things in a way I guess are hard on people to comprehend because they don't have that level of drive. Do you know what I mean? Has it always been like this for you? Have you always felt like you can set your mind on anything and you will achieve it, ultimately?

KW:I've always felt I can do anything.That's the main thing people are controlled by, thoughts- the perceptions of themselves.They're slowed down by the perception of themselves. If you're taught you can't do anything you won't do anything.I was taught I could do everythingandI'm Kanye West at age 36.So just watch the next ten years.

Thank God forStephen Hill, who is so sincerely good at exactly what he does and gives so much and doesn't care aboutwhat Ghost somebody's drivingor how big somebody's house is and brings the most awesome collection of classic, current, and futuristic black music every day. So make some noise for Stephen Hill to start this

So, since this is pre-taped and the fact that Adam Blackstone used to be my music director, I'm pretty sure he's not gonna start the music on me.If I go Chicago for a second, you know it was interesting when I went and visitedMinister Louis Farrakhan, and I just really wanted to expand so much more on the things that I had been talking about over the past couple years.And it was interesting or groundbreaking and really special for me to see his reaction and his expression about my relationship with a woman not of color, and for us to focus on the idea of love and not the idea of separation. You know, at the barbershop and everything, I used to hear people talking about, ""You know when an entertainer get on, of course you know he gon' go and get a white girl and buy her all this... and the white girl gon' go and get a rich black dude.""But I want to say that my wife has dated broke black dudes. So it ain't got nothing to do with the money

And it takes me back to a story she told me where her father, Robert Kardashian, walked out, and on the side of his Bentley, they wrote ""Nigger lover"" becauseRobert Kardashian was the genius that put together the defense team that got O.J. off.She had never seen her father curse, get mad, he was the most laid back human being. And he went so crazy and tried to chase the people down, and she sat there crying and said, ""Dad why you going so crazy?"" He said to her, ""One day you may have a black child. A beautiful, beautiful, beautiful black child. And it's gonna be hard, you're gonna see how hard it is.""

So true enough, we deal with racism because there are different races, or the micro of it is that we focus on the different races, as opposed to the macro, which is the human race. The bit of soundbytes that everyone loved from last year that got taken out of context or misunderstood did come from a place of saying part of the reason why I'm not allowed to be empowered is because of race, because of people's perception of celebrity,because all they want to present to young black men is the idea of making it to the league or making it to be a rapper, but not the idea of becoming an owner.And they would do anything they can to make it seem like a truthful idea is a stupid idea or a crazy idea. Harriet Tubman said she could have freed so many more, and I'm sorry mom if that was incorrect English. Harriet Tubman could have freed more if they only knew they weren't free.So don't think that because we can afford this custom Balmain suit that we're free. And don't think that because we can buy a $300,000 car that we're free.And don't think that because it's 3% of a gated community that has colored people in it that we're free. It's the mentality, the slave mentality, where we all eventually become slaves to that car. Slaves to the perception. Slaves to the idea of being cool

I thought it was so appropriate the way Wayne Brady kicked his whole shit off tonight. For us to express ourselves.Our power, our oil, since we don't own any oil. Our oil is our expression, is our influence.Don't never let them take that away. And when we have the chance to express it and influence, don't only do it for us, do it for the human race",rap,,,,Kanye West,2015 Zane Lowe BBC Radio Interview (Ft. Zane Lowe),http://genius.com/Kanye-west-2015-zane-lowe-bbc-radio-interview-lyrics,": Nice to see you again man. Thanks for stopping by the BBC for a chat

:  Good to see you too sir. Thank you

: So, I was thinking today like where do we begin?Because you‰Ûªve been having some remarkable conversations lately, some really in depth, really interesting conversations addressing recent things that have gone on, you know, successes, things that have kind of made people think, talk amongst themselves and it got me thinking like, where were we last time.We were 18 months ago, not far from here and so much has changed in the last 18 months. The first question I wanted to ask you, cause I‰Ûªve always wondered how you felt at that time

:I had so many interviews where I‰Ûªm trying to express that I can create, that I can create outside of just the music boxand I‰Ûªm giving examples of work that I did that was really successful and I‰Ûªm getting just completely shut down.But not just by the company we talked about last time but every single company, every single company you could imagine is just like ‰ÛÏno, you are celebrity.You are not allowed to create, you‰Ûªre not allowed to think, you‰Ûªre not allowed to have an opinion.You‰Ûªre just here to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.‰ÛAnd it‰Ûªs true that as a celebrity you can help to promote something quickly but no one wanted to allow me to think or be involved in the product and you know, as I told you last time I said I‰Ûªm a product guy

: Yea, and it was an electrifying conservation, and I mean, it felt like you were taking names that day, it felt like you were also trying to reach people that day and what‰Ûªs occurred since you know is you have made serious moves into that world. You know, what‰Ûªs happened recently with Yeezy supply, you know your deal with Adidas, how has that experience been overall for you now with product out and with peoples opinion about the shoes and about what they‰Ûªve seen -- how has that experience been for you? How can you put that into context for us?

:  I mean, every day when you go to the gym or you go to work it‰Ûªs a challenge. You gotta work hard and you have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what. So that‰Ûªs the way I‰Ûªmma word it. You know what I‰Ûªm saying, so we made it to a point where something extremely close, something almost to the level, something past the level of the vision finally hit the globe and Adidas was a company that was flexible enoughand had been used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to create something that was very close to my heart.You know, they original hip hop

: Of course, Run DMC man I mean they were right there at the very beginning it was kind of a perfect partnership when it was announced, you know, not long after and I wondered when did the conversation actually begin with Adidias after you starting talking about your aspirations and what you wanted to achieve in that industry?

:  That conversation had already started before then. There was a few conversations with a few companies with a few sportswear companies and um, I remember callingJon Wexleryou know, it was a certain point where I just felt like I couldn‰Ûªt breathe anymore like I had all these ideas and I felt like I was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone‰Ûªs creative, you know like we have this idea of a mass market looking at a celebrity that owns a Lamborghini complaining about something. And anyone that‰Ûªs creative understands that there‰Ûªs no amount of money that can be given to them to make them not want to or have to create.There‰Ûªs no check out and there‰Ûªs no cheque to stop you from creative. No pun intended when I‰Ûªm saying no check

: Was a good one though

:  Just even thinking about it takes the breath out of me because I mean, as soon as we got the opportunity to actually start making things, there were so many ideas. I mean I look at over 500 images a day on my laptop.And I remember I went into the whole thing about Hypebeast, you know I said ‰ÛÏpeople be dissing me on Hypebeast‰Ûand it‰Ûªs like wait a second, dude, like I been fighting this battle for a long time,since like Universe City.Like no one has any idea what the meeting were like. I‰Ûªmma throw this one out here. I remember this one guy that worked for Francois Pinault the head of Kering Group came up in my apartment in Paris, while I was working onand I had a meeting with him and it was related to doing a deal with Puma.And the guy, actually I forgot about the meeting right, so I had my jacket onand it was a jacket I had done with A.P.C.and I was about to leave, so he shows up at the door and we go to my dining room table and I‰Ûªm sitting with him, and I tell him like yo I made this jacket. And he makes some joke about, you know ‰ÛÏYou did look pretty hot. I‰Ûªm happy to know that you put on all those clothes for me.‰Û

: Was he joking do you think?

:He was leveling. He was leveling the conversation, this is what people do all the time.Like if I meet someone who I respect or I look up to, I will literally like kiss their feet.You know someone that I know that‰Ûªs put in a lot of work. And it‰Ûªs a lot of agents, a lot of people who work under the main guy that will level, that will try to level you. You know when they talk to you, they talk down to you. And I‰Ûªm just sitting like ‰ÛÏWhoa, ok.‰Û Obviously I have to show him like hey I‰Ûªm working on this stuff and it‰Ûªs coming out good and this is all I have a chance to work on.You know like when I worked with A.P.C. I only had two times to look at the collection, you know I couldn‰Ûªt really grab it and dig into it the way I dig into like working on ‰ÛÏAll Of The Lights‰Û or something like that, it‰Ûªs like, there‰Ûªs a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you‰Ûªre dealing with apparel and the way that people make apparel currently

: I can imagine the frustration for you at that moment in time as you‰Ûªre leading up to what has effectively occurred in the last year. Seeing something like you say, close to the vision you have in your mind. At those early stages, man the frustration of trying to get those ideas out and just like you said, and getting just levelled

: Everyone, everyone I talked to would try to level me. You know. And then there was this guy named Hermann Deininger that was the head of Adidas. And I say ‰ÛÏwas‰Û because he passed away recently.And I showed him what I shot in Qatar, the Cruel Summer film, that was using 7 screens, the surround vision idea which we‰Ûªve never shown online because you have to experience it in it‰Ûªs space.It‰Ûªs the same thing I showed Disney and Universal, and said you know this is the new frontier on the way we need to see film. And which I got all no‰Ûªs on that ‰ÛÒ to date. And this guy Hermann saw it, and he believed. He believed that maybe I had something more than how big my rap record was. In me he could tell, he knew, he‰Ûªs like this guy has something to say and to give that‰Ûªs past the current box that he‰Ûªs put in.And he made sure, Hermann and Jon Wexler made sure that Adidas deal got done.And the deal has nothing to do with the idea of the higher ups in society.The deal is all about the moment when I can bring a shoe to a kid a Foot Locker and get on my knees and take it back to when I worked at The Gap and put the shoes on his feet.That is what the deal is about.The deal is about when the star of a show is a 5 foot 3 girl, when there‰Ûªs never been a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of any fashion show.The deal is when the kids came to 42 locations across the world to see Yeezy Season 1 x Adidas Originals launch and the excitement that was in that theater,and when they saw that line up, they saw that brigade, they reacted to it when they heard‰ÛÏWolves,""when theysaw the boots, when they saw the runners, when they saw the matrix sweaters, when they saw all these things like hitting them back to back to back to back.This is what I fought for. None of this was about me having like a bigger house, a faster Lamborghini. It, like, it wasn't about that. It was about these kids having a moment. To be themselves. To be a stronger version, you know, of themselves. I make this stuff to empower people.I feel like there's so many things that are made to, you know, to wear the people as opposed to people wearing it.And I asked my assistant one time. I was like, ""how does these clothes make you feel?"" She said, ""I feel powerful."" And that's our, that's our main goal.As the song says, ""no one man should have all that power."" Noman should have it. Everyone should have it

: You seem to be totally, well, a lot more aware of what it is that.. well, in a much, sort of like a more focused way you're able to know where you wanna be and what impact you wanna have. And it feels like you're very attached to the well-being of the people and what they can get out of this. You know, and across the border. And when that moment kind of occurred to you. Cause that doesn't happen overnight, you know.. there's.. but it does lead up to that. And 18 months ago you were fighting, you know, you were like really fighting to be heard. And now it seems to me like you're very consciously aware

: Yeah, I was still off, you know what I mean? I might have some things that are off now, but I feel like, in the same way when I came up with""All Falls Down,""and I was able to differentiate myself from whoever I was trying to rap like at that point and I found my voice and my message. It's like, I felt like..

: That was the moment you felt like that was, yeah..

:When I wrote ""All Falls Down."" That's when I was like, ""okay, this is who I am in the.. this is what I'm, this is what I'm presenting.""So now I feel like.. it's funny, I would always say, you know,""I wanna sculpt with marble.""And it wasn't until I was working on, and I was learning about furniture and the fact that I am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to go to French flea markets and the galleries and buy, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot for.And one of the things they had was  this Le Corbusier lamp, and it was made of cement, and it was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he made it for Zeus, so he made it for everyone. And it was made of cement. So it wasn't the material, it was the idea that was the most important.And I always wanted the resources of LVMH, but it wasn't until I started taking the sensibility of proportion and color and finishing and applying it to fleece and jersey French terry which is a cement in comparison to, you know, the type of materials that Louis Vuitton might use. That I find a message, a voice, a reason, a reason to create. You know, it was a futile argument for me to say, ""hey, everyone, get behind me so I can make another $5000 jacket that you can afford."" It's like insane.But now I feel people rallying because they know that I wanna fight for H&amp;M, Zara type concept and I know that Adidas can eventually get those price points.And I want to apologize to everyone right now because I believe that Season 1 may still be in that upper price pointand there's still the words ""exclusivity,"" you know, being thrown around. ""Exclusivity"" is the new N-word. Not nigga, ""exclusivity."" Am I saying the word right?

: Yeah

: Yeah,is the new N-word. Cause nothing should be exclusive.Everyone should have the opportunity to drink from the same fountain.The idea of exclusivity is a new colored-people fountain concept. And saying, ""we're gonna overcharge sneaker culture guys to, you know, drink at the right fountain.""You know, we have to reboot our mentality. Period. Of a generation. You know, it wouldn't even matter if I sold one sweatshirt. You know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids hear this and know this and or someone in position of power or someone that will be in a position of power in the future has a chance to make a difference. And they say someone who was at the lowest point grabbing at straws, express themselves freely, and overcame it through all adversary, all adversity, means that they can do the same thing. You know

: Yeah. Because the thing is when people hear you talking at times I think that there's a genuine consensus from those cause believe me, you're compelling to a lot of people. And, you know, what you say is.. I think you have very unique views on things that should be heard. But some people I think have thought overtime  that.. they've obviously missed the point. They've thought that you bringing it back to you. But you're actually trying to open up to everybody else. You're trying to break down that barrier of exclusivity and say you know.. If you have to lead the way you have to lead the way. It might not end with you, but maybe if it starts with you is your point

: And I was, I was using the wrong words. My rap was wrong. You know what I'm saying? I was getting the drinks, you know, thrown in my face as opposed to leaving with the girl at the end of the night. You know, cause imagine, think about the type of shit, wild shit you say in interviews. And imagine if someone said this very thing to a girl at a bar.""Yo, what up, baby? I'm a genius!""They be like, ""yo, who's this guy?"" ""No, I'm telling you, I sold all this, I sold this many shoes."" Then she be like, ""yo, chill, chill."" Like, ""gosh, get me out of here already."" You know what I'm saying? And that's who I was and that was that frustration I had cause I'm seeing like this.. I'm looking at this girl like, ""man, I know that..""

: ""We could be good together, this could work.""

: Yeah, I know, I just don't know how to work it

: So I'm messing it up, yeah

:And the right way so I'm gonna stumble. I was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with like corporations and stuff you know..

: You're the 40 year old virgin of dealing with corporations?

: Yeah. I did not know how to communicate at all. And it's like I had my point, my message was, you know, simply like,""your egg, my semen, we change the world.""You know, and I imagine that that's gonna sound wrong

: That's a hell of a pick up line, man

: I mean, I like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, because wrong is okay, you know like..

: It's okay, it's okay, wrong..

: We have the right to be wrong sometimes

: That's a great line. You know I wanted to talk to you.. when we started talking, you know, a while back, music was on my agenda because, you know, I mean, we talked a couple times before as well. And you know I'm a music guy, I mean, it really drives me, and it's a big part of my life. And over the course of this conversation, you know, I wanna ask you at some point what the future looks like and feels like to you cause I'm fascinated in the certain things I wanna touch on, but I do want to talk about your forthcoming, new record if that's cool. Do you want to talk about music?

: Yeah

: Cause to me it feels like over the course of that frustration last time you had to make sacrifices to be heard and it felt like you didn'twanna talk about. You were like, ""that's cool and everything, but I wanna talk about this."" And lately, I just, maybe I'm, I feel like you're really energized with music in a big way

: You know, after I did the presentation in New York Iwas able to get that alien out of my stomach,you know like. I was on a flight back in the morning to go shoot the""Blessings"" video with Big Sean and Drake

: Yeah

: And I couldn't have been happier. To go and shoot this video with two of the hottest rappers in the game. Well, let's be respectful and truthful.hottest rapper and one of the hottest rappers in the game. And I fall somewhere in that, you know? In that, that field. So..

: Getting back to music for a minute, I feel like we're right back, I gotta bring you right back for a second. I want to know what we can look forward to on this record.You talked about cookout music, you talked about what this album represents.And every record you have made has been something new and fresh. You've taken yourself and your craft to a new place. Where's your head at right now with this new album?

: Just working hard. On it

: And it's fun?

: And it's fun. And it's fun to work hard and we're being inventive and I've still got some, you know, a lot of opinions and perspectives that I think are important and very.. can be inspiring to people. That fight, and you know,came out of a fight to want to rap. And this new album is coming out of a fight of wanting to design.And..

: I wondered about that, causewas punk-rock to me. That was like, that was Sex Pistols to me. That was like Public Enemy to me. That was one of the records that stands as establishing an industrial, strong statement. And I wondered like where the desire is coming from on this record. And without giving away too much cause the proof is in the hearing, the joy is in the hearing. Where it's coming from

: I mean, it's a joyful noise onto the Lord. Like, it is still, you know, the struggle, you know, but the beauty from the struggle. You know

: As opposed to just the struggle?

: Yea, the song Amazing Grace, you know coming out of the worst pain possible and making the most beautiful song you know, possible.You know I wanna perform‰ÛÏOnly One‰Ûmany times as possible. You know could be vilified or misunderstood, and like I said I didn‰Ûªt come here to be liked I came here to make a difference. I‰Ûªm not talking about this interview, I‰Ûªm talking about life. Some people‰Ûªs job they‰Ûªre very extremely likeable and I think I could figure that out. I think I‰Ûªm way nicer to people just in general. Everyone I meet I‰Ûªm extremely nice. But as soon as people start playing games I stop. I stop playing games. And at any moment I can hit that Ye button and we can go right back to day one. People be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick. But it‰Ûªs all love, and great energy and positive energy. I like the, I like the differences of views and our approach to music like when I‰Ûªm sitting making music with Paul McCartney and I come in I have all these lists of complaints like ‰ÛÏda-da-da-da-da!‰Û and this happened and that happened and he say ‰ÛÏYo man, it‰Ûªs all cool though! How bout we make a song?‰Û And we just make song, after song after song after song after song after song

: He is the most, cause I‰Ûªve met him many times now and he is just so tapped into the joy of making music. And he so gets it in the sense that it‰Ûªs like kinda let it lead you. Let the song sorta lead you to where it needs to go is the vibe I get from him like yea, let‰Ûªs just see where this goes

: And yea that‰Ûªs what we did. You know people think that our first two singles don‰Ûªt have drums but both of those are percussive instruments

: Yea totally that‰Ûªs what he‰Ûªs doing. That‰Ûªs like ‰ÛÏdun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun‰Û that‰Ûªs what it is. S I just wanna talk about working with him because I haven‰Ûªt actually seen too many people focus on that which surprises me, maybe I‰Ûªm wrong, but I just, I love the idea of that collaboration occurring and it‰Ûªs a natural one. Certainly on‰ÛÏFourFiveSeconds‰ÛI think that‰Ûªs one ofRihanna‰Ûªs greatest vocal performances period

: She was killing that right?

: My gosh man. I mean that‰Ûªs like a whole other attitude that I haven‰Ûªt heard from her as a star. She‰Ûªs really gone inside that record and wrangled it. How was it making that and getting that song out cause it feels effortless to listen to,it almost has like a 70‰Ûªs FM American rock, sort of country-rock radio vibe to it, you know what I mean, like something you would‰Ûªve heard in Los Angeles in ‰Ûª76 or something

: I mean I liked, I liked songs like that when I was growing up. And I mean the type of chord changes that Paul does, I don‰Ûªt need to understand them, and to be able to be involved with that..

: It‰Ûªs because he invented them

: Yea exactly. And be able to be involved with writing a song like that, it‰Ûªs just like way next to,like meeting Paul McCartney is like meeting Ralph Lauren

: Yea, totally!

: It‰Ûªs like ‰ÛÏwhoa!‰Û

: Dude he‰Ûªs the greatest

: The greatest of their field, period. Of all time

: And you got to say ‰ÛÏwildin‰Ûª‰Û in a song with him it‰Ûªs just incredible cause it‰Ûªs still hip hop, that‰Ûªs what‰Ûªs amazing about it

: Yea the whole cadence was trap. Soon as Paul starts playing, I start singing in trap

: That‰Ûªs again is the fusion of cultures which I love. It‰Ûªs what did you call it before when you when you were talking about Sean wearing [Raf?] and your shoes ‰ÛÒ you were saying, it‰Ûªs -- I can‰Ûªt remember what you said

:Fusion is the future. Period. The mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the two lunch tables working together, you know.Humanity period man, we‰Ûªre one people and maybe that‰Ûªs likeincorrect English ‰ÛÒ I‰Ûªm sorry mom‰ÛÒ but you know I went to Louise Wilson‰Ûªs memorial, you know the greatest fashion instructor of all time. And I‰Ûªm talking about.

: Educate us man, tell us

:Ok so Louise Wilson was the baddest professor of all time of any fashion school, ever.Notorious for not letting people stop at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to a 12. So the first time that I saw one of her students Pheobe Philo'scollection, I was looking at a 12. When I saw McQueen‰Ûªs last show thecollection, I was looking at a 12. Christopher Kane'scollection I‰Ûªm looking at a 12. Alber Elbaz I‰Ûªm looking at a 12. That‰Ûªs the designer, the designer ofLanvin which completely revolutionized the men‰Ûªs sneaker, fashion sneaker industry.Last time I saw her we had dinner at Hakkasan which is my favourite restaurant in London and I think she knew that she was gonna pass and she just wanted to give me some words of advice moving forward and she was asking me about my daughter, asking me about my wife. And she said so many students, they don‰Ûªt give it their all. And the problem is soon as they do anything halfway good, when they‰Ûªre 2 years old, 3 years old, their parents clap

:

:Exactly, that‰Ûªs what she said, they clap. And she just looked at me, she said ‰ÛÏKanye, don‰Ûªt clap.‰Û

: Aww, what, that‰Ûªs just! How you getting on with that?

:I didn‰Ûªt know we were gonna lose her.You know I just um, and she told me she said, you know ‰ÛÏthank you for the times you know, when we came to performances‰Û and ‰ÛÏthis has like really meant a lot to me.‰ÛYou know she would‰ÛÓ

Wanna take a minute? We‰Ûªll take a minute. Let‰Ûªs take a minute

: That‰Ûªs never happened to me in an interview before

: You ok?

: Yea, I‰Ûªm ok, I think I‰Ûªm ok

: We‰Ûªre gonna change the subject. Here we go. One of the things you said recently which really kinda made me think was you know you really truly believe that you‰Ûªre gonna be the head of the world‰Ûªs first trillion dollar company and the first thing that sprang to my mind Kanye was what is that company going to look like?

: Johnny Ive who is like, in my opinion from what I know, Elon Musk included, is like the world‰Ûªs greatest living designer and has the best mentality behind design. And I said from what I know because there might be other, there might be some others, there are a lot that are great but Johnny Ive's the best that I know. He said that people are so concerned at being first as opposed to being better so I think that, I think innovation almost gets too much credit, in a way. So, if we talk about this type of company, it wouldn‰Ûªt be a company of innovation because as Steve Stoute told me driving down the westside highway ‰ÛÏthere‰Ûªs no money in the innovation.‰Û

: Yea, and he‰Ûªs got a point

: The money‰Ûªs in the repetition, you know so..

: It‰Ûªs in the quality

: And making something of better quality for more people. So it has to be a balance of both. I‰Ûªve said this a few times but I wanna just say it right here for people who haven‰Ûªt read it or seen but I think people think that I pander to fashion particularly. You know because, people say ‰ÛÏwhy fashion?‰Û It‰Ûªs not politics, world war it‰Ûªs not that, it‰Ûªs fashion, it‰Ûªsa jacket or something, it‰Ûªsa dress. But I believe that the world can only be saved through design. And I think that the fashion world has.. and when I say through design, I know it‰Ûªs some snarky classist editor that‰Ûªs gonna take that and say ‰ÛÏKanye West said that the world will be saved with a couture dress.‰Û That‰Ûªs not what I‰Ûªm saying. The mentality behind design, you know art is to be free. Design is to fix

: This is important, you‰Ûªre talking about the actual, like you say the mentality, the purpose behind it, what it means behind the actual product

: No politics, just truth. Does it fucking work or not. Irrigation, you know, that‰Ûªs a form of design

: What are those conversations like, because you, one of the great privileges that you‰Ûªre in because you know you push yourself is that you get to find yourself in rooms with people that push themselves. So that conversations can be pushed. And I wonder what those conversations are like because I‰Ûªm fascinated by somebody like Elon Musk and his absolute inability to be restrained by boundary. And you are very much cut from that same cloth. What is it like when you guys get together and do you talk about things as kind of obvious or [?] as what the future will feel like or is it more casual than that?

: That‰Ûªs exactly what we talk about. What does Kanye West and Elon Musk talk about? The fut‰Ûª

: The fut‰Ûª -- TM

: So when I put out things that if I say hey, I want to work with Miucca Prada one day on highschool uniforms or something, I just put it out, you know. We just put it out there. Or as I told Obama last time I saw him, hey, I want, I would suggest that you sit with Elon Musk. I would suggest that both you guys go to China. I would suggest this. The, I think it may happen

: Must be amazing, those conversations man must be amazing

: I got scared of the idea you know someone call you crazy so many times you start to believe it. And I almost got scared of the idea of like going crazy in some way but I wasn‰Ûªt going crazy, I was like the only person thatcrazy. You know what I‰Ûªm saying like, I just stand there and I just look like ‰ÛÏis anyone else here seeing what I‰Ûªm seeing? None of you guys are seeing what I‰Ûªm seeing‰Û or it‰Ûªs just like your Maybach and your house is likeimportant that you won‰Ûªt move at all

: It‰Ûªs distractions

: That you won‰Ûªt say anything at all in risk of losing something. You won‰Ûªt say anything on anyone‰Ûªs behalf at this point? You know so, if you have that ability to do that, to see that, you know that Walt Disney ability in some way, you have to apply it. You have to use it. You can‰Ûªt be psyched out. You know, everyone‰Ûªs on our side. I was just in my own way, but everyone‰Ûªs on our side and everything that I ever said will happen, will happen. Just as much as you guys saw that Adidas Original Yeezys Season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you saw that front row. The juxtaposition of the people in the front and second rows to where the people standing in the show had come from is the fusion and is the future. It is the glass shattering of the class system, which is the new racism. Class is the new way to discriminate against people, to hold people down, to hold people in a place based on where their kids go to school, how much money they make, what they drive, where they live and what type of clothes they have and how much, you know, how much they have in their account for their retirement. To somehow say that this person right here means more than this person. Like I know I tweeted Black Lives Matter butlives matter. Like, my doorman is more important to me than any head of any company. He keeps us safe. My driver, keeps us safe and goes to work every day. The guy painting the windows at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know what the architect suggested, he is just as important as anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne. It‰Ûªs no more of this separation of what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty. Whatever it is that people use to separate people

: But was that moment, which I didn‰Ûªt want to talk about but you raised it and I want to actually bring this up because you have to learn from experience. You can‰Ûªt have all those answers straight away, you have to make those mistakes yourself I think in order to come to that level of clarity

: And I‰Ûªm not saying I have answers, I‰Ûªm just saying these are my current opinions. As I gave my current opinions a year ago, this is my current opinions now

: Sure, sure, and that‰Ûªs great, that‰Ûªs what we want, that‰Ûªs why I‰Ûªm asking questions so we get to hear your answers.But when you, I think‰Û_Cause you know I was nominated for that Album Of The Year as well as part of the Sam Smith album as a producer and a co-writer

: Oh, oh wow

: Right, so I was at the awards ceremony with the other producers and co-writers that are part of each records. And, like I‰Ûªm a huge fan of all the nominees that were nominated and I‰Ûªm a huge fan of Beck and it‰Ûªs funny that you say, you talk about everyone you want to get it to a place where people can exist in their own terms and that leaves it open for fusion. But then like you say you can just push a button and be back and be old Ye, you know old Yeezy. Is that what happened that night? Just ‰ÛÏgaaah, I can‰Ûªt take it I‰Ûªve gotta get up on this stage, I‰Ûªve gotta wild out.‰Û Cause we all thought you were joking. You know what I thought was brilliant about that night? When you did it on the night, I was applauding because I was like,‰ÛÏthat was Sun Tzu, that was Art of War.‰ÛHe waited for the right platform, went up, pretended to do it, walked back down everyone‰Ûªs like ‰ÛÏaww, so funny‰Û I was like ‰ÛÏhe just got the last laugh on this.‰ÛAnd then I woke up the next morning and it was like ‰ÛÏnaw, he‰Ûªs not an artist‰Û and I was like ‰ÛÏaw man, Ithat album!‰Û

: Yea, I never said that he‰Ûªs not an artist

: Ok, I‰Ûªm misquoting you. But you were talking about artistry. And do you learn form those lessons yourself? Is that when you kind of get a little bit closer to understanding what you believe is really important? When you do things like and think, well maybe I did kinda misconstrue that

: I think yea I misconstrued it but I think that everybody has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be wrong.You know, there could be a lot of people who feel Marshawn Lynch shoulda been handed the ball. But there‰Ûªs a bunch of Patriots fans that are happy he didn‰Ûªt get the ball.And everyone has a right to their opinion. You know, and I expressed my opinion, and I‰Ûªll take the weight of it

: He‰Ûªs great though. You know, he is great though. There‰Ûªs three..

: Naw you know as I said on theCharlamagne interviewwhen I was ironically having dinner with Taylor Swift, the Beck song starts playing and I was like ‰ÛÏthis is really good‰Û_ maybe I might‰Ûªve been wrong!‰Û You know like, and uh..

: It‰Ûªs a great album man

: And I hadn‰Ûªt been in like 6 years. And the Grammy‰Ûªs are definitely like an ex-girlfriend. Soon as you get in a car with them, you wanna go right back home

: So we‰Ûªre gonna get a record this year, and I‰Ûªm excited to hear it, I really am excited to hear it, and as we draw closer to the end of this particular talk I want to do it once again bring it back to like, the thing that really --

: only one thing I want to say, people say I‰Ûªm a hypocrite right?

: Some

: People say that right?

: Some

: Yes, I am. 100%. I‰Ûªm a human being. I‰Ûªm super hypocritical. I can feel something one time and completely a different way another time. I do it in the design office. I do it in the studio. I‰Ûªm super hypo- I really love this, I do it when I get dressed. ‰ÛÏI love this‰Û‰ÛÏIthis!‰Û

: How long does it take you to get dressed on a daily basis?

: 3 minutes. 2 minutes. Bars

: How long does it take your wife to get dressed every day?

: Sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes longer. I mean she‰Ûªs a woman

: Course. You know it seems that um, you know what I love about‰ÛÏOnly One‰Ûis the interaction and the way that you‰Ûªve been able to create different generations of your life and of your family communicating with one another, through one another, as a portal. And I love that. And I think it‰Ûªs one of those songs that successfully does that. And um, I‰Ûªm a father, you‰Ûªre a father, it‰Ûªs the greatest thing of all time. No question about it, it is the great level of all time, it‰Ûªs the greatest thing of all time. ",,,,, you know your daughter is what, 18 months now? 18 months old? You an only child?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, I‰Ûªm practicing really hard. I try as many times a day as I can. Nori this one is for you! You need a sibling!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and all the ones where everyone‰Ûªs like totally engaged with everything you‰Ûªre saying, for right or for wrong or whatever, I think you‰Ûªve got it totally sussed. I think you know you absolutely know that you‰Ûªve talked recently about being the villain, like how you know everyone wants the villain and everyone does well when the villain opens his mouth kinda thing. But then at the end of the day you can go on another interview and you can show a really softer side and a very understanding and very human side that people who know you will tell me you totally are, 100%. And it‰Ûªs so funny it goes from like ‰ÛÏBoooo!‰Û to like ‰ÛÏYeaaaa!‰Û to like ‰ÛÏBoooo!‰Û to like ‰ÛÏYeaaaa!‰Û and it‰Ûªs like, I think you‰Ûªve got it sussed, I think you know what‰Ûªs going on all the time with all of this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, you win or you. Bam, there‰Ûªs a jewel, I‰Ûªll take that one with me,,,,,,,,,,,,,, quote book. So album this year, sneak attack, no doubt, no question, sneak attack‰Ûªs coming and um, and there was a leaked poster that came out as well, you gonna tour with Rihanna? Is that out there now? Has that been confirmed or not confirmed, or what the story with that it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, but needless to say you‰Ûªre excited about returning to the stage in some capacity this year and we‰Ûªre looking forward to new music this year,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, and I been doing a few performances since doing the SNL performance, did a couple performances out here and of course gonna do the Brits. I‰Ûªve been really liking these performances. I feel like these are like the performance version of that you know Drake, you know of the 6 God album, of the you know. I feel like I‰Ûªm a visual extension of what he‰Ûªs doing like sonically,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,‰ÛÏ6PM in New York‰Û‰ÛÒ that moment when he‰Ûªs like opening up and telling the truth about how he feels about his detractors and he‰Ûªs just basically just opening up what‰Ûªs going on is my real honesty, not guarding himself or hiding away with any bravado or anything. Just like you know, ‰ÛÏthey scream my weaknesses and whisper my accomplishments‰Û likeI mean that moment for me is just like, that‰Ûªs what, I mean I love that about him that he‰Ûªs totally open in the sense,,,,,,,,,,,, that element is great. There‰Ûªs a lot of people that can‰Ûªt rap that can do that. But the main thing is that fact that he‰Ûªs delivering you know a level of product ‰ÛÒ as I said last interview, I‰Ûªm a product guy ‰ÛÒ and he‰Ûªs delivering a level of product to humanity that is of high quality. It works. 80% of the time works all the time!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, but it works. It works. You know what I‰Ûªm saying. And you have to.. it works. That‰Ûªs it. And I was just thinking like, I don‰Ûªt have any advice for this young man, but what I can say is run. Fly. Go as fast as you can. Don‰Ûªt stop. And you know any time I can be of any service, advice, you know a beat, verse, you know whatever you need. You need some confidential design advice with the shoes you doing over at the other company, I‰Ûªm not supposed to say that! You know anything that we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the world as a team. You know, not just me and him. Us all,,,,,,,, I really do.

I don't wanna be famous, I just wanna be rich


I don't wanna be famous
Fuck around, be a Lennon and a fan leave you brainless
All in the paper, gettin' buried  by a neighbor
While all of your relatives spendin' all the money that you gave 'em
Fuck it, don't save 'em
Let that boy drown if he don't float, guess he wasn't made for it
My nigga hold it, hold it down, listenin' to underground
Poppin' knuckles cause these niggas wanna bring me down
Put your face in the dirt like 4th down
Niggas wanna test, but we will never fail
I'm layin' low in my day clothes
Can't get a fuckin' meal at Pollo Loco without takin' photos
Man, these little crazy niggas (loco)




I don't wanna be famous
Flip a finger, middle finger, let 'em know that I'm dangerous

And my bitch'll fight ya, Hilary Swank ya
Take your bitch, we ain't even swingers

You all in arraignment, snitchin' to the plaintiff

""***Flawless"", BeyoncÌ© video. And Beck needs to respect artistry, and he should've given his award to BeyoncÌ©.And at this point, we're tired of it.Because what happens is, when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in their face after they deliver monumental feats of music, you're disrespectful to inspiration.We as musicians have to inspire people who go to work every day, and they listen to that BeyoncÌ© album and they feel like it takes them to another place.Then they do this whole promotional event, they'll run the music over somebody‰Ûªs speech, the artist, because they want commercial advertising.Like, no, we not playing with them no more. By the way, I got my wife, I got my daughter and I got my clothing line, so I'm not going to do nothing to put my daughter at risk but I am here to fight for creativity. That's the reason why I didn‰Ûªt say anything tonight. But y'all know what it meant when 'Ye walks on the stage",rap,,,,Kanye West,#9 Kanye West - Yeezus by Rock Genius  (Ft. Spinelli & ‰ÛÜstreetlights),http://genius.com/Rock-genius-9-kanye-west-yeezus-annotated,"Kanye's(a burned copy of course). I popped it in, ""Heard 'Em Say""started bumpin' andi was ROLLIN HARD!This beat was so money...Kanye had been a great producer from the get-go, but he was coming into his own as a rapper. Fast forward to 2013 and he's basically the biggest rapper on the planet. Forget the chill vibes of ""Heard 'Em Say""...Adam Levine? Ha...hell no. Kanye's got wayy too much to get off his chest onto fuck with Maroon 5. This is a guy on top of the world...literally. And looking at the world through his eyes is nothing short of fascinating





is wayyyy more than rap. We see this the minute the album opens, on ""On Sight"" and Yeezy ain't fuckin around. He's gotDaft PunkANDBenji Bproducing the track with him? The result is some HEAVY synth that's nothing short of cosmic.Think of the club in that new Tron movie where Daft Punk was playing.If you were at some club in the matrix or in outer space somewhere, this is the beat you'd be hearing. 'Ye intersperses a sick soul sample and just goes off on a tirade, highlighted by gems like:Ok..I see where this is going.Right into another Daft Punk collabo on ""Black Skinhead."" A track filled with HUGE drum hits that he dropped a dark and often times terrifying interactive video for.This is not just some regular-ass album release. This is next-level shit. We see him just not giving a fuck by dropping perhaps the most disputed lyric of the year:Can't tell you how many fan boys and girls were FURIOUS at this one.""It wasn't the Romans in that movie! It was the Spartans!"" But man, Kanye delivers it with such emphasis. He doesn't stutter for a second and he's so wrapped up in the beat. It's like the brilliant thespian who skips a line and you don't even notice, you're just enamored with the performance. He got everyone talking with this slip-up, or was it?

Everything seemed so calculated with this album and it was genius stroke after genius stroke.The first taste we got of the record was the global premier of the ""New Slaves"" video. A cryptic map on his website showed the locations of this video projection in major cities around the world.I was in San Francisco at the time and trekked down to 2nd &amp; Mission at 11pm with a buddy and a flask. This was some guerilla shit for sure. These surly dudes showed up with a full-size pickup truck and what looked like a 200 pound projector. The surly dudes pulled up the projector with all their weight to position it and they beamed Kanye up on a high rise in the financial district that was maybe 300 yards away. This was surreal. The video played three times in a row while the music blared on a single massive speaker. By the 3rd time, we were rappin' along. Sharing booze, dancing in the street. It was so dope. As it ended, i yelled out a scream ""let's go to the next one!"" and we trekked over to Union Square for the 1145 showing. THIS is what being a star is about these days. How you gonna top what the last guy did?! And there was nothing that felt contrived about it. You could feel Kanye's emotion on the Big Brother-like projection of his head against a building




In fact, this is the quality that sets Kanye apart, nothing feels fake. If you've seen interviews with the guy, he has SO much emotion. He truly believes in everything he says. THIS is art. Dude can say shit like""I Am a God""and it ain't tongue in cheek at all.He knows the masses are hanging on his every word, just licking their chops waiting to derive meaning from it, waiting to break it down.THIS is the lens through which he looks at the world. He's the face on the side of the building and you either soak it all up and act like you belong there with every inch of your body, or you don't cease the spotlight and become just another singer. But don't think that the spotlight doesn't get to him. It pisses him off. The ravenous media attention and countless organizations calling for his head infuriate him and it makes his expression that much more real and defining




For all the anger, for all the lines like ""Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign,"" there's beautiful prose and social commentary with the impeccable Nina Simone sampled on ""Blood on the Leaves.""He goes straight for the jugular with the provocative subject matter and puts difficult conversations at the forefront. ""Blood on the Leaves"" is a masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and read the annotations on Rap Genius, especially the words on the production of this song. There's no issue this man is not ready to bring up.And I'm just scratching the surface. I could write into the night on this album.We could sit here and talk about Kanye's ability to elevate a talent like Justin Vernon to the top of the indie rock world.We could re-hash his words in the countless interviews and rants, but there's no way i could do it as well as the users on Rap Genius already have done (in fact, to bring authenticity and the right frames of reference to this post, i've collaborated with Kanye's top scholar on RG to make many of the annotations you're reading right now.) The annotatedis some of the richest content on the entire site. Dissecting every stanza, every beat, every move of this album, for the monumental accomplishment that it is.Even Lou Reed thinks so. LOU FUCKING REED! Read his words,crumble your preconceived notion of Mr. West if you don't like him, if only for a moment, to look into what his music and his ART is made of. Cause it's unlike anything that's ever been done and there's much more to come....

There is now over twenty-five feet of water where there was once city streets and thriving neighbourhoods.

[Mike Myers]: And subtle and but in even many ways more profoundly devastating is thelasting damage to the survivors‰Ûª will to rebuild and remain in the area. The destruction of the spirit of the people of Southern Louisiana and Mississippi may end up being themost tragic loss of all.

Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could
But(You make me smile)


What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja,Henny and Coca-Cola
Then I'm co coming over cause it's never over




I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now,I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja,Henny and Coca Cola
And I keep co coming overcause it's never over




I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to um, let me, how would I put this uhh
Let's say all your friends, remember the one
You said if you ever she would be the one
Ok, ok, ok (You make me smile with my heart)
I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me: I mean just, uhh, not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly, I mean let it be

Last night I had a dream
Thoughts was racin through my head, it was all a dream
Felt so real to me
This is what was said


Had a dream I said
Bout who he said
Bout B.I.G. I said
That's big he said
Dig what he said, proceed he said
Indeed I said, so
Breathe I did
Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothing
He agreed with his head
He just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I repeated what was said
It came to me like a whisper last evening I said
What's the deal playboy, was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?
More money, more problems, better believe it he said
Careful what you wish for you might receive it he said
""I see"" I said, ""jealousy"" I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said,Hovremind yourself
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Getting stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
Just keep doin your thing he said, say no more




Was it all a dream - tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
I gotta know {*""It was all a dream""*}
Was it all a dream - was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam


It was all a dream
I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock til my tape popped
Smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rapping Duke, duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the ........
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowing up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga


I see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said,Hov remind yourself
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did

I'm so appalled, Louis Vuitton draws
The shit, a booth for me is a bathroom stall
If you're not fond of me, you're comedy, Little Duval
I have a lot of flaws, I'm human before all
I wake up in the morning smell some coffee, then tell your bitch to get off me
Mos Def, word to every autopsy
Man that boy bad, man that boy spaz
'Til he crash like Sandra Bullock and Luda on the ave
He changed his name, he a conscious rapper
Naw mutha'fucka I'm just Compton's rapper
I might spit some intricate shit for retards not to get
But really I'm just as rude as Marshall Mathers
Is that a contradiction? He contradicting himself again?
Of course that's a contradiction, the fuck you think life is?
We not like like Christ is
We all want ices and devices to make the bitches say I like this
People don't understand why I went southpaw
I looked in the mirror and said I can't be like y'all
I can't be like Game, I can't be like Eazy
To get in this rap game, I know it won't be easy
Cause my shit different
I know
He from Compton, where he from, have he killed before?
Truth is, I ain't the most ruthless, but I'm not cupid
Before she had two kids my momma worked two gigs
To get out Chicago
To move right back to another ghetto,on Sante Fe playing the lotto
I used to want a champagne two door Tahoe
Until I seen that same truck shot by five-o
Dead with his eyes closed, y'all should've seen him
Off a gallon of cough syrup, but rifles had leaned him
That's why these tough rappers man I don't believe 'em
Y'all wanna be 'em, I wanna grab bats and beat 'em
So they can feel the pain of the blocks I'm from
Where my heart turned numb
And the powder and the shells come up off that gun
Come up off your chain, or come up off your life and have a fatherless son
It's the syllabus for the ignorant militant mind
'quivalent crimes for jail sentencin'
No one preventin' this war
You sure, you sure
Sure as the edges on every ocean, now let's explore
The Kendrick Lamar LP I been promotin' for 'bout a month
Don't worry its comin' soon, like a fast nut
I never be gassed up, some labels they passed up
Now the industry crashin', I guess they got bad luck
Your bad, you don't write neither? There goes another fad
Shit I write ether
I get it in like the Vanna on Wheel of Fortune forcin' your forfeit
With the strength of the prime forces of four fork lifts
This is very extra necessary
This extra scary,this is Amityville
This the Exorcist on ecstasy pills
And if I can't do it my integrity will
Head dog wishes, every Compton bitch is
I mean this shit is
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
They all got a fat ass but lower case titties
Now I gotta mix and match, jungle fever, white and black
Double D, Brittney, Becky get your mouth intact
Reg call 'em Jabberjaw, she gon' hop skip and jog
Just to read my twitter blog
Man these hoes pitiful
And to you bloggers that say I'm weak
You know how long I took to chop this fuckin' beat?
Y'all don't 'preciate shit
All y'all do is hate shit
And if I don't say shit y'all still say I ain't shit
And that's ridiculous
I mean that shit is

They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store
When I die, bury me inside the Louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

I'm in the kitchen, yams everywhere
Just made a juug, I got bands everywhere
You the realest nigga breathing if I hold my breath
Referee, with the whistle, brrrrrt, hold his tech
Extendo clip,extendo roll
When your girl leave me she need a hair salon
Hair weave killer going on a trapathon
See I done had more bombs than Pakistan
Dope bomb, dro bomb, and a pill bomb
See nigga, I'm balling, you in will call
When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store
When I die, bury me inside the Truey store
True to my religion,two everything I'm too different
So when I die, bury me next to two bitches

It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh
She holding out, she ain't giving to the needy huh
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on
Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a mÌ©nage
Especially if you put that BMW in the garage
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her do better
She said how bout I get you jewelry from the West End
How bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend
I'm joking, I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be acting like no actress, if we preaching then we practice
Don't be reaching, don't be touching shit
We in Kanye West's Benz
Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian

You in first place, you in first place
Bad bitch contest, you in first place

Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on
(What I'm seeing from the back I can't front on)
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl

Told you motherfuckers keys open doors up
Never excited when I'm seen with something gorgeous
Put highway miles on these bitches like a tour bus
Daddy Warbucks, without a born trust
Diamonds all on this black gold like an oil rush
The highest quality, the chains are all flush
Known Jacob since the nineties so he spoils us
Stock spoilers, no kits on 'em
Why Panamera, nine-eleve shits on 'em
Chuck the deuce as I Tokyo drift on 'em
The top drops like this Bangladesh heat on 'em

Yo, get yourself a hundred years tryin' to be the boss
Stand next to the chandeliers, you could see the shards
Ain't no diamonds in the watch, but you see the cross
When you spoon feed them that dope they need it more
All night, sweet sales
Four pipes, V twelves
Yeah, you know what them grams do
Bad bitch with me that the industry ain't ran through
Na, I ain't stop hustling yet, but I plan to
Own a bunch of vehicles and a bunch of land too
Yeah and I love it when the rush come

Got my own label, fucked around and signed myself
Had a plan and stuck to it, you fuckboys is stuck boy

Tell the whole world to suck my cockiness

Three hundred thou for the watch and rocky shit

Bitch I'm so fly, you should check the altitude
I'm ballin', ballin' like an alley-oop
My girl heel so high she need a parachute
Get 'em, I got 'em let me at 'em
My condo on Jupiter, my neighbors on Saturn
Murcielago, flow with some eye candy
I go to trial Monday, I been takin' panties
Hundred degrees in the mic booth
I'm from where you put golds on the white tooth
And when you walk in and she might look
Might get took, might get fucked

Graduated from them blocks, now it's stocks and bonds
Hoes wanna know, hoes wanna show
They know a nigga's name, they know a nigga's strong
Fuck wit me!




When I climb on top, I say I'm into you
A lot of chickens in the coupe; cock-a-doodle-doo
I fucked the secretary, fuck the interview
If I was in the NBA, I'd hoop in Gucci tennis shoes
Chopper spray like antihistamines
Triple beam,Versace swag on creatine
When I left the lot, I spent a half a milli
When I pulled up to your spot, I had a half a ceiling
Got your bitch with me, trying to suck up

Humble yourself, you not a G, keep it one with yourself
Run to niggas for help, favors I keep one on the shelf

Hit you right above navel, now you swimming in pavement
Gold medals on my neck, I call it Michael Phelps
Hoes settling for less, I call 'em bottom shelf

On the road to the riches, bitches not tagging along

If them niggas pussy, we douche 'em, we clean 'em out
This the voice of ghetto intelligence
If you got work, go to work, don't work at your residence


...For presidents
Word to Muhammad, that triple beam is heaven-sent
Riding through the jungles in that muthafuckin' elephant
That's a gray ghost, with the ears on it
Swimming through the hood like it got fins on it (Tell 'em!)

That I'm Serious, that Trap or Die
Is the only thing on my playlist
I smoke swisher sweets when I chief blunts
Peters Street is where I eat lunch
Took your girl out to Lenox mall
She went downtown like Peidmont
Cause A-town my playground
I hate clowns that face frown
Cause it stay down from my waist down
Then I bus on em, Greyhound
Shawty yeen know your girl was a freak bitch
Today she let me hit for a 5 dollar bag of green
Now that's why I give her free dick




Ok I'm sliding down on Lenox, keep evicting my crown
I hit the mall and I spend it, all this money I count
I remember the Poole Palace,I remember the Bounce
Throwing up the A-Town, throwing up the A-Town


80‰Ûªs baby, Grady baby,my Auntie was a candy lady
And her baby had a baby,the A-town born and raised me
Southside, own that, Candler Road if I had to go back
Tony Wiggles on my throwback, had your feet on my door mat
Dirty South I know you heard about it, got loud I know you heard about it
Valley park I used to roll around, 2 Chainz with your girl around me
Two down, I'm too down,Kilo and Sammy Sam
Raheem and Outkast, Goodie Mob: ATL




Riding in the Cutlass smoking on a black
Man it don't get more Decatur than that
What's better than that
Ain't nothing better than that
Ain't nothing better than that
See through the bullshit like cellophane wrap
All the slick talk we don't entertain that
Better take a step back
Last nigga came 'round here talking shit, left and never came back
Nigga I'm high, high like eagle pussy
Rolling up a heavyweight rap
My crib lay back,my chick lay back
My seat lay back,yeah everything match
Niggas tryna act brave, man we the home of that
You looking for whatever it's a zone for that
Getting paper ain't nothing wrong with that
Yeah we bout that coin like a laundromat
Maybe Candler Road make me feel like this
Or maybe Outkast make me feel like this
Put your A's up if you feel like this
We get the Georgia Dome jumping like we still got Vick
It's a dirty game and they scared of that
Blame it on the red and black
What better than that
Ain't nothing better than that
Ain't nothing better than that

Cell phone ringingtryna blank it
In D.C getting money, DMV one hundred
Hair hanging down to my stomach
And I'm making play like DeShaun
And I'm ballin' out like John Wall
I just brought me a pound of gas
I'mma smoke joints till it's all gone
Okay awwsome, in a Porsche eating lobster
2 chains on with crosses, lipstick stain on balls
I ain't with the losses, the process is nonsense
Whip,sit in all set, might give her the sausage
Me andSkoolywalk, talk down to the car
Hit her with the dick, leave her with a beauty mark
She say we all the same, I say ""bitch come hit this reefer""
She say that ""I don't like them niggas"", I say ""I don't like 'em either""




A$AP tatted on my belly like I'm Makaveli
That peanut butter product probably why they acting jelly
You actin' petty,packin' daily cause my chain heavy
Flaco be in D.C. like I'm Wayne Perry
I beat that, speak that awwsome
She wanna have a foursome
She know more friends so call some
Call them often for the moresome
Exhaust 'em, boss 'em, toss 'em
Loss 'em like abortion
Window shopping notion
Wasted times important
Problems with it cost 'em
All you boys fugazy,I got hoes for days
My rugged lookin' J's bout as stainless as my braids
But I'm paid, shout glizzy

Throwin' Hundreds out the sun roof cause I'm a stunner
Thought she was the one till I heard she was a runner
Went behind her back gave all her friends my number
She roll another blunt up, blowin' till I pass out
Made it rain twenty racks still pullin' cash out
Mashed out the lot made the Vet' do a tailspin
Pipes growlin' like a pit bull at the mailman
Got buyout,got shooters on deck
That's why I walk around with thirty-thousand on my neck
They show respect because they know my background
It's summertime, tell them bitch niggas I'm back now



Pockets so thick like I just hit the number
Ran through it all now I'm back on the come-up
Pulling something slick that'll make these niggas wonder
Told y'all bitches I'd be straight by the summer


Told y'all bitches/Right Back 4 Da Summer
I Told y'all bitches/Right Back 4 Da Summer

Fucking up ya' plans though, sweet taste of victory
So for the time being y'all relaxing when it's history

I'm doing me but these all hoes is for everybody
Ran through it all, but homie I will never fall
When the clubthat shit is like a mating call

It bring me great pleasure to know I hurt these niggas feelings
Whatever you do I always got 1-up
Had a rough winter, but I'll be back by the summer






white V-Neck
on the car like a T-Rex
I got my music up and my top perm
That means its laying down 24's on the curl
Twenty birds on the stove I get it cooked cheap
Three birds everyday it's been a good week
Sold two birds Sunday cause I went to church
And since it's summertime I guess I'm going with the Verse
All these chains on a nigga need two necks
I don't fuck with groupies but I have group sex
2 Chainz name ringing like a telephone
And all I eat is beats, and yellowbones

Keep 'em high


N-n-n-now, myflow
Is in the pocket like wallets,I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it,I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
'Til I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said I'se a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow
My heart, and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash your skull
And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't, usually smoke
But pass the'dro
And I won't, give you that money that you asking for

[Verse 2: Kanye West +(girl)]
N-n-n-n-n-now who the hell is this
E-mailing me at 11:26?
Telling me that she 36-26, plus double-d
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now she just lamping, chilling on campus
Sent me a picture of her feelin' on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T-E, it's getting late mami
Your screen saver say tweet, so you got to ""call me""
And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli
(You mean Talib? Lyrics sticks to your rib)
I mean(That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)
I mean (You don't really know him, why is you lyin')
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time
And get her high


Yo, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes
But never mind,I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow,you trying to blow backs out
Well okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm
Ayo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?
And sister's the bomb,boy she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a okay playa hater
Anyway, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much or trying to get off cigarettes?
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
Now I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubba kush and a sister could get a hit of it


Get 'em high like noonor the moon
Or a room filled with smoke,a hype filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the noteswith real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote
Control rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs, it's like Tiger
Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show,called Soul Survivor
I stole on liver, niggas than you
You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me
They say Hip-Hop is dead,I'm here to resurrect me
Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come, you the hot garbage of
The year's clear your image and snooped up
Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga
Read the infra-red across your head,I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver,I ain't a Madd Rapper
Just an emcee with a temper
You dancing for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wiresand fires, emcees retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then

Escuchela.. la ciudad respirando


The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shining, like who on top of this?
People was tussling, arguing and bustling
Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustling
I'm wrestling with words and ideas
My ears is pricked, seeking what will transmit
The scribes can apply to transcript, yo
This ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive,let's describe the inscrutable
The indisputable, we New York the narcotic
Draped in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips
For profits, thirsty criminals take pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches
Skyscrapers is colossus,the cost of living is preposterous
Stay alive, you play or die, no options,no Batman and Robin
Can't tell between the cops and the robbers, they both partners, they all heartless
With no conscience, back streets stay darkened
Where unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbing
You either make a way or stay sobbing
The shiny Apple is bruised but sweetand if you choose to eat
You could lose your teeth,many crews retreat
Nightly news repeat, who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight to savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative rose to explain this existence
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance


So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin holes in the night til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out,weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving


Breathin in deep city breaths, sittin on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, hell froze the night the city slept
The beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicatin with one another
And ghetto birdswhere waters fall
From the hydrants to the gutters
The beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin
You on the wrong side of the track, lookin visibly shaken
Taken them plungers, plungin to death that's painted by the numbers
With Krylon applied pressure,cats is playin God
By havin children by a lesser baby mother but fuck it
We played against each other like puppets,swearin you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Gettin knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everything is fair
It's a paradox we call reality
So keepin it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally like, Mickey and Mallory
Not knowing the ways'll get you capped like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceeing to illustrate what we be seeing
Hard to be a spiritual being when shit is shakin what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm asking if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded
My blood pressure boiled and rose,cause New York niggas
Actin spoiled at shows,to the winners the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife the Roman Empire state



[Spanish speaking woman] Escuchela.. respirando ??


Yo...on The Amen, Corner I stood lookin at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixin down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I choreograph seven steps to heaven
In hell, waiting to exhaleand make the bread leaven
Veteran of a cold warIt's Chica-I-go for
What I know or, what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib I spend months gone
Sat by the window with a clutched dome listenin to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord, but didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own
Outta the city, they want us gone
Tearin down the 'jects creatin plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Ask my guy how he thought travellin the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep

What? What? Come on (Yeah)


""Give me the fortune, keep the fame,"" said my man Louis
I agreed, know what he mean because we live the truest lie
I asked him why we follow the law of the bluest eye
He looked at me, he thought about it, was like, ""I'm clueless, why?""
The question was rhetorical, the answer is horrible
Our morals are out of place and got our lives full of sorrow
And so tomorrow coming later than usual
Waiting on someone to pity us while we finding beauty in the hideous
They say money's the root of all evil but I can't tell
You know what I mean, pesos, francs, yens, cowrie shells, dollar bills
Or is it the mindstate that's ill?
Creating crime rates to fill the new prisons they build
Over money and religion there's more blood to spill
The wounds of slaves in cotton fields that never heal,what's the deal?
A lot of cats who buy records are straight broke
But my language universal they be reciting my quotes
While R&amp;B singers hit bad notes, we rock the boat of thought
That my man Louis' statements just provoked
Caught up, in conversations of our personal worth
Brought up, through endangered species status on the planet Earth
Survival tactics means, busting gats to prove you hard
Your firearms are too short to box with God
Without faith, all of that is illusionary
Raise my son, no vindication of manhood necessary


Not strong (Only aggressive)
Not free (We only licensed)
Not compassionate, only polite(Now who the nicest?)
Not good but well behaved
(Chasing after death, so we can call ourselves brave?)
Still living like mental slaves
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice
Hiding like thieves in the night from life
Illusions of oasis making you look twice


Yo, I'm sure that everybody out listening agree
That everything you see ain't really how it be
A lot of jokers out running in place, chasing the style
Be a lot going on beneath the empty smile
Most cats in my area be loving the hysteria
Synthesized surface conceals the interior
America, land of opportunity, mirages and camouflages
More than usually, speaking loudly
Saying nothing, you confusing me, you losing me
Your game is twisted, want me enlisted in your usury
Foolishly, most men join the ranks cluelessly
Buffoonishly accept the deception, believe the perception
Reflection rarely seen across the surface of the looking glass
Walking the street, wondering who they be looking past
Looking gassed with them imported designer shades on
Stars shine bright, but the light rarely stays on
Same song, just remixed, different arrangement
Put you on a yacht but they won't call it a slave ship
Strangeness, you don't control this, you barely hold this
Screaming ""brand new"", when they just sanitized the old shit
Suppose it's, just another clever Jedi mind trick
That they been running across stars through all the time with
I find it's distressing, there's never no in-between
We either niggas or Kings, we either bitches or Queens
The deadly ritual seems immersed in the perverse
Full of short attention spans, short tempers, and short skirts
Long barrel automatics released in short bursts
The length of black life is treated with short worth
Get yours first, them other niggas secondary
That type of illing that be filling up the cemetery
This life is temporary but the soul is eternal
Separate the real from the lie, let me learn you
Not strong, only aggressive cause the power ain't directed
That's why we are subjected to the will of the oppressive
Not free, we only licensed,not live, we just exciting
Cause the captors own the masters to what we writing
Not compassionate, only polite, we well trained
Our sincerity's rehearsed in stage, it's just a game
Not good, but well behaved cause the camera survey
Most of the things that we think, do or say
We chasing after death just to call ourselves brave
But everyday, next man meet with the grave/Great
I give a damn if any fan recall my legacy
I'm trying to live life in the sight of God's memorylike that y'all


A lot of people don't understand the true criteria of things
Can't just accept the appearance, have to get the true essence

Just to stop smoking and stop drinking
I've been thinking, I've got my reasons

Just to get by, just to get by


We keeping it gangster say fo shizzle, fo sheezy and staying crunk

Shit and all they got is rapping to listen to

Even when the condition is critical, when the living is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshitting you
Now, why would I lie? Just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly
The TV got us reaching for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars
The ones that be reading for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners, Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need something to rely on,we get high on all types of drug
When, all you really need is love
To get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
Our parents sing like John Lennon, imagine all the people watch
We rock like Paul McCartney from now until the last Beatle drop




Yoyoyo, yo
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high

I said Manhattan keep on making it, Brooklyn keep on taking it
So relax we're taking it back,Red Hook where we're living at
Plenty cats be struggling not hustling and bubbling
It ain't about production and ‰ÛÒ what else we discussing?
When the cock crows, my crop grows,enable me to rock flows
Striving for perfection ever since I was a snot-nose
Colossal!True original b-boy apostle
Standing on the rooftop with the Zulu Gestapo


You think you the shit
Somebody in the wings'll force you to quit
It could be your crew or clique
Or some random kid you smoked buddha with
Consider me the entity within the industry without a history
Of spitting the epitome of stupidity
Living my life, expressing my liberty, it gotta be done properly
My name is in the middle of equality
People follow me, and other cats they hear 'em flow
And assume I'm the real one with lyrics like I'm Cyrano


Still sipping wishing well water, imported from Pluto
Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all the believers
In miles or kilometers, most cats, cannot proceed us
In the jungle with the leaders, we them lions, you the cheetahs
Ourcypher, will complete us as we come throughyour receivers
You can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us
(Line for line)Good Jesus!Mos Def and Kweli just
Make a pussy freeze up; think it over, ease up

So I start looking out the window
I see gun store, gun store, liquor store, gun store
Where the fuck are you taking me?


We bout to twist it up
We bout to lift it up
We never givin' up
The startin' salary, it's hard reality
Find solidarity
We got our leaders too but where they lead us ?
Do they leave us or they see it through?
Yeah we packin' precious metals
Our shit is next level
We raise the threat level


Every ghetto, every city, like Ms. Hill
They way too used to the missed meals
Hard to concentrate, hard to sit still
Murder rate permanent place in the top 10
We live here, these hipsters drop in
You hear them barrels cockin'
They say consciousness mean a nigga ain't rugged
Until they get beat within an inch of it
Self made niggas don't get discovered
They actin' like you owe 'em somethin'
Homie I don't owe you nothin'
Fuck your beef
It's way too early in the mornin' for the hate
You ain't brushed your teeth yet nigga
And your toast ain't buttered
A perfect storm and the coast is flooded
Most discovered that my flow got 'em
You posers sound like [?] stuttered
Man I'm goin' too fast, let me slow it down


I'm good walkin' in every ghetto around the world
The hood often embrace ya when you profound with words
I say the shit they relate to, I keep it down to Earth
Other rappers sound like they hate you, them niggas sound absurd
So when they walk through the ghetto they get their chain snatched
They gotta talk to the ghetto to get their chain back
It's like an open air prison and it remain packed
Nothin' but straight facts


Indie 5,for the people by the people
Ya-ya, giddy up, who got the juice now?
Snatch it out your kiddies cups
The shit you gave us watered down
This one's for Basquiat
They be brushin' with death, uh
Is thisfor cops?
We double-dutchin' duckin' shots
Every home ain't got a Pops
Every man ain't sellin' rocks
A different will to win here
Different from switchin' cars
They pray that we switch our bars
To a fiend from a metaphor
Worldstar, Worldstar
Lotta love and this life hard
Keep us prayin' like ""oh God""
Illegally thievery think us peelin' off easily
Frustrated we hate it
That's why we scream out ""nigga we made it""
It's an odd future they ain't know we was all some creators
Somethin' from nothin' was told Kings walk and man you frontin'
For the people and by the people but them over money
I'm on my Viola Davis here, workin' for justice
How you get away with murder? Be a cop and just kill us
How we supposed to not catch feelings?
Innocent lives, boy we got kids in these buildings
I'm on my Viola Davis, it's what you call a defense
For all the drama they gave us I'm spittin' Shonda Rhimes wit
Too high for you like ganja, that‰Ûªs what Shonda rhyme with
I holla back in the Hamptons, you still black if you rich
Spread love ain't just the Brooklyn way, it's universal
360 and the nine lives, whoa, what a circle


We bout to live it up
We bout to give it up
We bout to twist it up

Yo, just relax, take it easy slow down
I had this, I had this friend of mine
Who just, you know, he was moving too fast, you known I'm saying?
I told him to slow down, he said the sun don't chill
I said, I said still, I said still, you gotta
Just appreciate life, sit back, don't let it fly right past you
No matter what go on I'm still gettin mine
No matter the year, no matter the place, no matter the time


Check it
It's like I'm fighting for freedom, writing for freedom
These record company niggas I don't like when I see 'em
My ancestors, when I'm writing I see 'em and talk with 'em
Hoping in the promise land I can walk with 'em
Shitted on so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall with 'em
Molest concepts,stalk rhythms,paid dues, bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call
Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall
MCs reckless eyeball, why y'all wanna go and do that?
Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't theU-Ac
No mo', still together
Like in the ghettophoto with one nigga in the chair
Holding liquor in despair,gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say I'm nice with metaphors but these are similes
Street ministry,my poetry's a penitentiary, track is visitation
Sentences is life,I'm like chief up in this demonstration
Still...




You squirm with discomfort, wiggle and cough
Six days of madness and you might throw me off
On this great ball of stress that they call the earth
I'mma show y'all in rhyme just how much shit I been through
And all the places I went to, always played the low
It's like a competition, this mission here I'm telling you
Slip up and rhyme-ass niggas here is felling you
Crash courses, slow down you can't learn that quick
Cause I'm the dead eye,with the red eye, fromChi to L-I
I thought y'all knew, every year I grew, I'm still growing
And in a year or two I hope my girl'll be showing
A male seed,praise God I name him Moses
I lead people I want him to, that's why I chose this
Now is the glass half-full or half-empty
Common, why they tempt me
Theking of the simply, bore in mic
I always stay on top cause I give niggas what they like
I know y'all hate that why I feel I owe y'all everyday
If y'all hear it a thousand times, it's gon' be the same way
The 'Dat-Father, go farther, why bother
Now I'm a peaceful man, I don't want no stress
You know I'm still...




Yo yo, some get Range Rovers, some religion change-over
Angel on my main shoulder telling me remain sober
Token nigga, game's over ain't no payola in freestyle
In battles, I'm warring like a G-Child
Searching for the child in me, this style in me
This release is like the piece that's now in me
They tried to 'sassinate me god, like Martin on the balcony
Lyrically I put a hit on 'em, cause I'm the style ""Nitti""
Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty
Trying to get a chick to kick it with metill the tilt
Told her my chamber's like Wilt
Built with her for a sec, let her know I had respect
Less than a hour she was giving me neck, yo I'm still getting mine

",rap,,,,Talib Kweli,1st Time (feat. Consequence) (Ft. Consequence),http://genius.com/Talib-kweli-1st-time-feat-consequence-lyrics,"There‰Ûªs a first time for everything
There‰Ûªs a first time for everything
But don‰Ûªt be afraid of what‰Ûªs in the dark
Just open your eyes and see what‰Ûªs in they heart
I remember the first time I left it up to you
But I learned from the first time to never trust in you


Ay yo, the first time ever I saw your face
I recall the case
Cut the grass now I see all the snakes
My lawyer man cake
Cause of you he‰Ûªs been employed by the beef
And now it‰Ûªs time to half court in the street
Falling asleep on your boy is not recommended
He felt the weapon in your chest because I‰Ûªm well respected
So when you disrespect reflection then your health effected
I go harder than any demon that hell invented
I never felt threatened
By none of these industry motherfuckers
Cause they smucks and they blood suckers
You can come quicker than sideways or backwards
I always come straight up in your face
Your mistake is confusing me with a rapper
That interviews and a fashion
You assuming I‰Ûªm passive
I‰Ûªm really truly a master
Of lyrically moving masses
It‰Ûªs true but if you attack us
I‰Ûªm never the one to back off
Never the one to slack off
I‰Ûªm making them take the mask off
It‰Ûªs beautiful when I black out, it‰Ûªs natural like disasters
My body is like a host for a ghost of the middle passage
You not imagining the noise you hear is laughter
They giggle behind your back you enacted your family matters
You read into what‰Ûªs happening and kill it like an assassin
Looking for that applause when all you get is the clappin‰Ûª
I‰Ûªm serious about my craft don‰Ûªt ever confuse the masses
By taking my outtakes and trying to repackage them
It‰Ûªs never forgive action




You only get one chance to make a first impression
That‰Ûªs why I always make sure I come the freshest
Whether I start or my words ending
I‰Ûªm here to exercise my first amendment
Which gives you the right to get your verse played
I almost lost that after the third grade
Cause on the first and fifteen before I stayed
My team was the first to get paid
So why would you cross us in the first place
Unless you willing to catch a first case
You better all go on on your first date
To see if you can get past first base
This the first taste of what the pain gave me
You listen to the rumors you would think they played me
But they my juniors, my first babies
I only deal with presidents like the first lady
Who pay me on a first name basis
I don‰Ûªt like you niggas I‰Ûªm almost racist
That‰Ûªs why I‰Ûªm cursing the first person or cursing the first person who didn‰Ûªt make my first purchase
But type my name in they word searches
Cause I kill the flow bring out the first hearses
And this will be the first crime you ever seen
But it‰Ûªs cool cause there‰Ûªs a first time for everything




Before the ink dried and the deal was finalized
And the money changed hands and the plan was monetized
We used to eat mcdonalds fries
Shop for economy size
Know when economists lie
We poor we trying to survive
Another stat-istic of a man with some kind of pride
I‰Ûªm getting black listed like I‰Ûªve got a communist tie
Little did I know it was myself I was trying to find
Getting all kind of high
Crashing like vehicular homicide
But now I‰Ûªm self employed and I‰Ûªm chilling
I‰Ûªm waking up with the millionaires
You looking for the building I‰Ûªm still in there
Still in fear
Scared of the dark that don‰Ûªt matter
When the lights come on the cockroaches scatter
Exposing the data
Yo get a load of these actors
They cloak and dagger
See how I broke they swagger
My spirit is rich
Yea the lyrics is sick
Get prepared lyricist of the year in this bitch

Forwhodo we aspire to reflect our own people's death
For who's entertainment shall we sing of agony? In what hopes?
That the destroyers aspiring to extinguish us will suddenly
Suffer remorse at the sight of their own fantastic success?
The last imbecile to dream that dream is dead
He was killed by the saviors of his own dream
Armah, 2000 seasons


I'm not a human being getting on some spiritual shit
A spiritual being manifested as a human that's it
When I spit I spray thoughts that's representing my life
Yo I step into the spot leave niggas open like mics
Take on em on a tour
Explore psychologies of war
Things you can't imagine if you've never seen em before
Shorties come back raw
Straight out the c- 74
I welcome them back to the world they think is run by laws
The world is run by men who use laws for tools
But I come thru war tactics like Shaka Zulu
Mcs is soft like play-doh
I shape 'em
Smash em to pieces
Volunteer
Slaves crave the words I'm painting
The masterpieces
You hear em on the radio babbling
The truth is traveling with the word
I sent flying through the air like a javelin
Unraveling like a verdict
Pound it in your chest like a gavel in the highest court
InBablyon, let's travel on
If the world is foul, and you think foul is how you got to live
Then from the get your ass was foul
And foul just is how you is
No excuses see, life's dilemnas are set up like a mirror
Just to show you all your faces
Now your understanding is clearer
You had your chance for evolution
You let it pass you by
That's why
I'm dissing wack mc's till the day that I die
Reflection getting you high
We stand our ground with the believers
The leaning tower of Pisa and the Pyramids of Giza
No comparison
The way I flip it is embarassing
Tis the season
Ain't no caroling


All knowing
Flowing like spring water in the desert
Balling through thebarren land
Where niggas take a stand, like castles made of sand
Free falling
For anything
Nothing but a plan to fail for they selves
No sense of delf, needed daily affirmations of self help
Yo it's right in front of yo grill stop looking everywhere else
Speaking of planning
Hustling and scheming
Looking for hookups
Took up too much time
Like a fiend for rocks that got cooked up
God bless the child that got his own shit
I got my team's
So the fiends now become opponents
They the opposition
Stronger from competition
Shining like a golden shower, your face I'm pissing in
Completing a genocide mission like
The Warren commission
Like fathers was supposed to be missing
While our sisters were supposed to be whoring
Save it for a rainy day,money is pouring
Under grey clouds, black butterflys still be soaring
Flying infrienldy skies
We classifying the highs
Blood be flowing in the streets like crimson tide in my eyes
The thai be having me drowsy
But I get mellow with the chronic
Intellectuals embarrased cause we discussing ebonics
I'm on a roll like sonic
In an age that the plague got bubonic proportions
Yo I call it reparations, but they call it extortion
Whatever
Just give me mine
But caution
You've been warned for the very last time
I'm not telling you again
So relay it to your crew
You gotta actually to do
Forget the drive in, driveby and drive through
You've got to
Get out the car
Humble yourself
Tilt your head back, and look at the stars
Shining over someplace very far, from where you standing
When the night is clear
You understanding just who put them there
What you know about the space you get lost in
Your peoples can't hear you in the distortion
The desert is absorption
And you sucked and you stuck off american freezing for like
2000 seasons
Upon your return from raping and crossbreeding
Your own people accuse you of deceiving and misleading
Causing mass confusion. Drug abusing
Now you all caught up in institutions
At this time you've got to break it down and be showing and proving
An A&amp;R told me that I use too many catch phrases
True I'm trying to catch all my people in all different stages all
Different phases

It's like that y'all...",rap,,,,Talib Kweli,5 AM in Brooklyn,http://genius.com/Talib-kweli-5-am-in-brooklyn-lyrics,"Y‰Ûªall niggas soft, b, y‰Ûªall niggas soft, b, you‰Ûªre spoiled

Now it‰Ûªs served to you on a silver fucking platter
Now y‰Ûªall niggas overly concerned with how a nigga look
What a nigga wear, who a nigga fuck
That‰Ûªs soft shit, b
What part of the game is that? Aye
But I love these niggas
I approach all my niggas with love, man
I approach all these niggas with love, man
Yeah
Why? Why?


Love never fails, fuck your fairy tales
I‰Ûªm never scared,plus I do this rap shit very well
I aim to let my shit bang, turn the levels up
Party over for you niggas, time to settle up
All of a sudden y‰Ûªall wanna know my opinion
But a nigga been official I‰Ûªm holding down my position
Looking for the answers, ain‰Ûªt no solution, there‰Ûªs not a problem
They tryna turn up, my catalogue speaks volumes
When I say I‰Ûªm a man of the people I really mean it
I don‰Ûªt just mean the people that I agree with
Now I could probably use some tact and some proper diction
But that‰Ûªs why I‰Ûªm an artist, not a politician
And that‰Ûªs why I‰Ûªm the hardest regardless
If you think I‰Ûªm a Prisoner of Conscious I illicit certain responses
To make me the poorest choice to be backed by a corporate sponsor
So I'm independent as fuck and my Company Flow gets Rawkus
Sometimes I get exhausted, there ain‰Ûªt no rest for the weary
I never forfeit, I‰Ûªm ill until the coffin
It‰Ûªs lower than to the ground they say the lion left a pawprint
Body of work is so vast, so enormous
Y‰Ûªall niggas ain‰Ûªt about shit, get your mouth split
Blood dripping all out your lip, on your outfit
Talking all that loud shit, I‰Ûªm thorough as you say you are
Niggas twist your words so I gotta watch what I say on blogs
These niggas leaving comments, but they scared to at me
Put in the work that I put in and then holla at me
I got love for every artist, I‰Ûªm more than just a product
I‰Ûªve been a prisoner, see Mumia,I‰Ûªve been to Cuba to see Assata
Way before Mr. and Mrs. Carter went on a dinner date
I had to send the lyrics ahead of time before I hit the stage
So scrutiny is not new to me I just usually
Only respect the opinion of those suggesting unity
Love hip-hop, stop it I don‰Ûªt believe you
And loving hip-hop don‰Ûªt got nothing to do with either
Caught up in the gossip and rumors you not consuming
So I‰Ûªm shitting on these niggas like Revenge of Montezuma
If you demand it trust the market will supply it
They complain about the music, but they never fucking buy it
I kinda get it though, we asking them to cop it
And they probably like, ‰ÛÏWhy? You waking up in a new Bugatti‰Û
Shout to Future,this for my chicks who rocking the Scotts with the poodle
And party like Adam Scott on Hulu
Set to wake these niggas up like cock-a-doodle-doo
‰Û÷Cause my spit more ludicrous than Shaka Zulu
These pseudo-intellectual metrosexuals try to confuse you
And knock you off your schedule putting death on a pedestal
But rhyming describes the times that ricin was sent to federal buildings
By cowards capitalizing on our confusion
Now we trapped in speculation the caterpillar the butterfly
Who get blinded by the light while they stripping us of our rights
I'm not giving up on the fight or set ‰Û÷em up with the left
Then knock ‰Û÷em out with the right
I be rocking the shit for life, yeah

They never catch the wagon like Re-run and ""What's Happening""

They come sweeter than sabal and softer than mashed potatoes
I tried to told you the rhymes run over emcees like Land Rovers
Took 'em back in time likeSankofa,Sankofa

The fire is trapped in a belly,ready to pop like canned soda

Touched down in New York

Money it's classic these bastards try to treat us like cattle
So life has been a constant battle, battle
Rising above the crabs in the barrel
Way too used to living in death's shadow
We stay on point like the best arrow, arrow
We hit the target accurate
Star shit, back it up
When we hit town, y'all niggas pack it up
That's how we get down, straight smash it up

Hydro on the brain and maintaining
Game changing into subtle shit, we remain blatant

You get replaced in this game, by Kweli
Place the face with the name

But now, I'm trying to be honest love, so can you
Sometimes people evolve but that involves knowing exactly what you want
And right now, I want a compromise by giving your partner what they want
My life is an open book,you had a chapter but will it end happily ever after?




Life ain't a fairy tale
Now they say sister's bitter and the brothers is grim
Time to let the story end and let another begin
I spun straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Still a hole in my soul that love won't fill in
She Sleeping Beauty cause her eyes was closed
Tried to sleep on your boy like Brian Rose
Now she wild like the coke in your nose
And I'm lying like Pinocchio,gotta know when it's time to go
Gotta know when it's, here we are, we had some good times
Had some Little Red Riding Hood times but once again
I'm the big bad wolf, don't hit me with the sad look love
Here I am, I'm still the same old me
But I don't know if we should give it one more chance
To add another chapter, life ain't always happily ever after

All the corners filled with sorrow
All the streets are filled with pain
Around my way...


People let me paint a picture
You know I ain't a Christian
I ain't a Muslim, ain't a Jew
I'm losing my religion
I speak to god directly
I know my god respect me
Cause he let me breathe his air and he really blessed me
I ain't knocking you, butI don't fuck with hospitals
Spit the gospel, truly knowing jesus like apostles do
Return like the prodigal son to honor Mohammed too
Stay away from ham like Abraham,Lord I follow you
Even when you took my man Chaka God and what I'm a do
You gave the hood a modern day martyr in Brother Amadou
I'm on the block, I'm tracing your footsteps, I keep the faith in you
Your love, plus hard work and ambition
We gonna make it through,my songs is psalms I'm spiritual when I'm lyrical
This is for my soldier niggas looking in the mirror who
Sitting home scratching off serials eating cereal
The way we find a way to survive, shit is a miracle
We got mice in the crib and roaches in the toasters, rice in the fridge
Bread in the oven by the roaster
We be takin' gypsy cabs and chasin' 50 bags
They be laced with shitty swag and it really get me mad
The way we saluting flags, wrapping them around our heads
When niggas ain't become American till 9/11
Feeling like you gotta sneak into heaven
When the reverend looking like a pimp and the pimp look like the reverend




These conditions make us strong
And we create our own businesses so later on
Our children have things in their name that they can say they own
A mix tape freestyle become your favorite song
No place like homewhen the cops ask you about your neighbors
Beat on you, threaten to incarcerate you
Till you spill your guts like you a Garcia Vega
We roll blunts not the papers
Cop the greatest take it coast to coast
L.A. to ChicagolikeSmooth Operators
Cop the Dro and cop the blacks
Cop the four, cock it back
Drop the flow,rock a hat on top a stocking cap
Be a doctor or a lawyer or make your momma a promise that
You'll finish school, but when you got a dream you gotta follow that
And make sure when you make it out the hood, you always holler back
Think about what you got from that
And always put your dollars back
On top of that, this is a legacy and we a part of that
The hood is where my heart is at
Catch me around my way

That's my art in your eyes, my life in your hands
We living next door to the Aquilius again
Pardon me fam

I'mma show you how we get in


Rocking the Guy Fawkes mask like Anonymous
Passport pimping like I'm going outta town to flip
The ass for a symbol with the cops hopping out of whips
Bath salt niggas with the zombies apocalypse
I'm blessed cause my afterlife is the studio
This rappers life is gangster's paradise like I'm Coolio

You talking shit? we don't need the chatter
Opinions are like assholes, not everybody fecal matter
So they straining to push it out, put they foot in their mouth
That's when I'm letting the Brooklyn out when they pull it out
Better let it off cause you set it off

Threw away the dark meat but they ate the white
Animated like it's kind of darklit it's my wicked life
It imitate my life

Coming full circle echelon don emcees with me
Tired of saying I'm the best, I won't waste another breath
Heard lyrics coming back, I say it never left
Y'all just catching up, so slow to come around
Ice-T gave ya cliff notes, I ain't gotta dumb it down
Cause I read the book, made the movie and I edit this
All while I be living it, and set the precedence
And get the presidents, fuck all the chit chat
Might hear the click clack, and I'mma diss back
Married to the game get the rice out Riff Raff
Nice being self employed, ain't gotta kiss ass
I ain't gotta slim fast, smack a ho with a love handle
Dare you to say you ain't a fan boo, roll a bamboo

Appears a curious celestial phenomenon
Called Black Star, but what is it?


Black people unite and let's all get down
We got to have what? We got to have that love


What is the Black Star
Is it the cat with the black shades,the black car?
Is it shinin from very far, to where you are?
It is commonplace and different
Intimate and distant
Fresher than an infant


Black, my family thick,like black strap molasses
Star, on the rise, in the eyes of the masses
Black is the color of my true love's hair
Star's are bright, shining, hot balls of air


Black like my baby girl's stare
Black like the veil that the muslimina wear
Black like the planet that they fear, why they scared?
Black like the slave ship belly that brought us here
Black like the cheeks that are roadways for tears
That leave black faces well traveled with years
Black like assassin crosshairs
Blacker than my granddaddy armchair
He never really got no time to chill there
Cause this life is warfare, warfare


Deep on the front lines, and blacks is all there
Black like the perception of who, on welfare
Black like faces at the bottom of the well
I've been there before
To bring the light and heat it up like la cocina
Make without imagine happen but maybe I'm just a dreamer
I love rocking tracks like John Coltrane love Naima

Like the student love the teacher
[T] Likethe prophet love Khadija
Like I love my baby features
Like the creator love all creatures


Who are knowledge, truth, and peace seekers
We on point like heat seekers
Targettin the black marketing strategists
Run up on em with the heaters
Everybody followin with no leaders
Feelin like we killin ourselves
Because I know they can't defeat us
It don't stop til we complete this, keep this fly
There's so much to life when you just stay black and die


Blacker than the nighttime sky of Bed-Stuy in July
Blacker than the seed in the blackberry pie
Blacker than the middle of my eye
Black like Fela man cry
Some man wan ask ""Who am I?""
I simply reply, ""The U.N.I., V.E.R.S.A.L. Magnetic""
Work to respect the angelic
Climb the mountain top and tell it'til the valley's enveloped
You're full of big chat but you nah know me
I'm dark like the side of the moon you don't see
When the moon shine newly

Lint on your clothes

We see through your voodoo
Just like Eve's Bayou, you dealin with that black magic

Be unlucky for you like a black cat

Used to kick dust in the air, now we're settling

Came here on a boat like Elian

Ten thousand hours strong
Just to keep the lights and the power on

Taste is sour, that's the agony of

Spill your blood like a battle with Crips

Catch me crossing items off my bucket list
Cause life is good as you want it to get
I paint a different portrait with any color I find
The canvas is the world and the brush is my mind
I don't mind stepping out my comfort zone
I think the greatest fear is the one of the unknown
If you afraid of living and you afraid of death
Then I'm afraid you'll never take a step to the left
Or the right direction

And what would really happen if I fought that vision

And all you hear is connivin' and gossip and contradictionand
You try to vote and participate in the government

Lookin' for the remedy but you can't see what's hurtin' you

And if I need to bring the girls together music's my dyke
So if I degrade it and I hate it, even cried through it
I watch brothers prophesise about dying through it

A picture of you pop up when I google monotony
Now all the people who rule and spend responsibly
Think your album is trash and it's not thevoodoo economy
So you expecting the conscious and introspective views
Eat your lyrical vegetables, let me tell you what‰Ûªs best for you
My music give you a message true and respect is due
But music is emotion that‰Ûªs lost on the intellectuals
A tree fall in the forest is never heard
Amongst the sparrows and the robins and even the ghetto birds
You download it for free but what I create is sacred
It cost you nothing but I pay to make it, trust me


Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my heart, my music
Like a medicine in times of war, helps me get over
The sweetest sounds I ever heard, my joy, my life, my music


I was born on the afterbeat
I'm like Robert Johnson
When you reach the crossroads
Me and the devil have to meet
It's all the same thing as clever Lauryn when they saw it Lauryn went
Looking for God and 'Clef kept tourin'
We listen to the same songs but we hear them different
Serenade of death like we got a fear of living
Having a seance on stage cause the spirit risen
Stop the devilish ways with clever displays of lyricism

Looks any different to me

And looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan

Who are you?
Oh wa oh wa oh wa oh wa






I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup

Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now

Becomes part of the machine

Got such a supple wrist

Can't hear no buzzers and bells
Don't see no lights a flashin'

And everything I do's been done before

At each end of my life is an open door


Automatically defrosted
When manhood came on time

The life that I'm assigned
A life that's been used before
A thousand times

Do not let go the coat


It is easy to be sad: when you lack a partner
But how would I react to a broken heart now
It is not really true rock and roll unless I am
Hanging onto you and when I hold it next time


I will not let go the coat


I try to explain but you never understand it
I need your body but I cannot just demand it
I will not let go like a stray at heel
(Never let it out of your sight)
Every lonely wife knows the way I feel


(Do not let go tonight)
Do not let go the coat
Never let go the coat


Your friends all pass for life is just a market
But you have to finish everything you started
So I live my life tearing down the runway
Sure to get the hang of hanging in there someday


Do not let go the coat
Will  get no more chances - forget the war dances
Go blind and hang on ‰ÛÒ do not try the slang son
Never let go the coat",rock,,,,The Who,Dreaming From The Waist,http://genius.com/The-who-dreaming-from-the-waist-lyrics,"I feel like I want to break out of the house
My heart is a-pumping, I've got sand in my mouth
I feel like I'm heading up to a cardiac arrest
I want to scream in the night, I want a manifest
I've got that wide awake, give-and-take, five o'clock-in-the-morning feeling
I've got the hots for the sluts in the well thumbed pages of a magazine
I want to drive, want to fly like I do in the dreams I've never really been in
I want to hump, want to jump, want to heat up, cool down in a dream machine


I'm dreaming from the waist on down
I'm dreaming but I feel tired and bound
I'm dreaming of a day when a cold shower helps my health
I'm dreaming dreaming - of the day I can control myself
Day I can control myself


Sound like a priest and then I'm shooting dice
I'm burning tires with some guy whose hair is turning white
I know the girls that I pass, they just ain't impressed
I'm too old to give up, but too young to rest
I've got that numb-to-a-thumb over-dubbed
Feeling social when the world is sleeping
The plot starts to thicken then I sicken and I feel I'm cemented down
I'm so juiced that the whorey lady's sad sad story has me quietly weeping
But here comes the morning
Here comes the yawning demented clown


I'm dreaming but I know it's all hot air
I'm dreaming I'll get back to that rocking chair
I'm dreaming of the day I can share the wealth
I'm dreaming, dreaming - of the day I can control myself
Day I can control myself
Hey, hey!
The day I can control myself",rock,,,,The Who,Drowned prod. by Kit Lambert,http://genius.com/The-who-drowned-lyrics,"There are men high up there fishing

Let the tide in and set me free

Then flying through the sky
I'm travelling down cold metal
Just a tear in baby's eye

And she's buying the stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying the stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven


Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it makes me wonder


There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking




And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter


If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady,can you hear the wind blow,and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind




And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll


And she's buying the stairway to heaven",rock,,,,Led Zeppelin,Black Dog prod. by Jimmy Page,http://genius.com/Led-zeppelin-black-dog-lyrics,"Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move

To sit with elders of the gentle race, this world has seldom seen
They talk of days for which they sit and wait
When all will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate, the story was quite clear

I've been flying, ain't no denying, no denying

As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Heed the path that led me to that place, yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds,fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear

Sending off a glancing kiss, to those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil's in his hole
Oh to sail away, To sandy lands and other days
Oh to touch the dream, Hides inside and never seen
Into the sun the south the north, at last the birds have flown
The shackles of commitment fell, In pieces on the ground
Oh to ride the wind, To tread the air above the din
Oh to laugh aloud, Dancing as we fought the crowd
To seek the man whose pointing hand, The giant step unfolds
With guidance from the curving path, That churns up into stone
If one bell should ring, in celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat, As proud the head with heavy feet
Days went by when you and I, bathed in eternal summers glow
As far away and distant, Our mutual child did grow
Oh the sweet refrain, Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh Albion remains, sleeping now to rise again
Wandering &amp; wandering, What place to rest the search
The mighty arms of Atlas, Hold the heavens from the earth

Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now, It's very easy just


Met a man on the roadside crying, without a friend, there's no denying
You're incomplete, they'll be no finding looking for what you knew
So anytime somebody needs you, don't let them down, although it grieves you
Some day you'll need someone like they do, looking for what you knew

Smoked my stuffand drank, all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching, in my heart
Someone told methere's a girl out there
With love in her eyesand flowers, in her hair

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow, could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
Asthe children of the sunbegan to awake
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high


To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams

Pray for the other ones

Are the clanging chimes of doom

Let's Do the Do honey I'm on a mission


Ain't no mistaking, my body's shaking
My soul's been taken
By a Devil with a New Disguise
The girl's so witching, my backbone's twitching
Because down in Hell's kitchen
The Devil's got a New Disguise


If you see Kay, tell her I love her
She did me in but I'll recover
She said love was her desire
All that she touched she set on fire
She was so diss - I couldn't slay her
She blew a kiss - I threw the dagger




She came from the wrong side of town
Everytime she got off she gets knocked back down
She's Heaven materialized
She's giving me Hell but it ain't no suprise
She's a bit uncivilized",rock,,,,Aerosmith,"Do They Know It's Christmas? by Band Aid  (Ft.

We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard


But when you're
There's ayour window
And it's a world of dread and fear


Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears


And thethat ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom


Well tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you


And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life(Oooh)
Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow

Raise a glass for everyone


Here's to them


Underneath that burning sun

Now their smokin' up the junk bonds
And then they go get stiff
And they're dancin' in the yacht club
With Muff and Uncle Biff
But there's one good thing that happens
When you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit
But go real good with wine




Believe in all the good things
That money just can't buy
Then you won't get no belly ache
From eatin' humble pie
I believe in rags to riches
Your inheritence won't last
So take your Grey Poupon my friend
And shove it up your ass!

Remember those nights you spent alone
Talking on the telephone?
Thoughts of you go through my brain
You told me that you felt the same
You told me that you love me too
Tell me who would lie with you?


I was talking birds
And you was talking bees
And he was down upon his knees

Sticks and stones won't break my bones
I know what you're looking for
You ate your cake, you want some more

Done everything I'm going to do

In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the Earth is old and grey, little darling we'll away
But my love this cannot be
Oh so many years are gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me




Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand
For my life
Still ahead

Calling you, calling you on

Just keep on building on the ground that's been won

Take it sonny, hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it all again before you die

Through the years till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will -

You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death


Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say


Home, home again

And when I come home cold and tired

I do believe its working. Good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go


There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look and it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
And I ‰Û_ have become comfortably numb

Getting lonely getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

Hey you out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?

Hey you with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high
As you can see
No matter how he tried
He could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

Always doing what you're told
Can you help me?

Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?

Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside

So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock, they won't do it again

I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of opinion
But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?

Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!

Threatened by shadows at night

Just trying to kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walking away
If we could take the time
To lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine

Or I'll just end up walking

And shadows still remain

So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
Cause nothin' lasts forever

Look at your
Women crying

Look at the hate
We're breeding
Look at the fear
We're feeding
Look at the lives
We're leading
The way we've
Always done before


My hands are tied
The billions shift
From side to side
And the wars go
On with brainwashed pride
For the love of god
And our human rights
And all these things
Are swept aside
By bloody hands
Time can't deny
And are washed
Away by your genocide
And history hides the
Lies of our civil wars


D'you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said peace
Could last forever
And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
I went numb when
I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of
D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom
When it's not in your hands
When everybody's fighting
For their promised land

It buries the poor
Your power hungry

In a human grocery store

You're filling
Look at the blood
We're spilling
Look at the world
We're killing
The way we've
Always done before
Look in the doubt
We've wallowed
Look at the leaders
We've followed
Look at the lies
We've swallowed
And I don't want
To hear no more


My hands are tied
For all I've seen has
Changed my mind
But still the wars go on
As the years go by
With no love of god
Or human rights
Cause all these dreams
Are swept aside
By bloody hands
Of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross
Of homicide
And history bears the scars
Of our civil wars


We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and Government officials
For example, we create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer


I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while
It buries the poor

Now we all know better

If I were you
I'd manage to
Avoid the invitation

Of promised love
That can't keep up
With your adoration

Just use your head
And in the end
You'll find your inspiration

To choose your steps
And won't regret
This kind of aggravation

",rock,,,,Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,http://genius.com/Guns-n-roses-breakdown-lyrics,"We all come in from the cold
We come down from the wire
An everybody warms themselves
To a different fire
When sometimes we get burned
You would think sometime we could learn
The one you love is the one
That should take you higher
You have got no one
You better go back
Out and find her


Just like children hiding in a closet
Can't tell what is going on outside
Sometimes we are so far
Off the beaten track
We will get taken for a ride
By a parlor trick or
Some words of wit
A hidden hand up a sleeve
To think the one you love
Could hurt you now
Is a little hard to believe
But everybody darling sometimes
Bites the hand that feeds


When I look around
Everybody always
Brings me down
Well is it them or me
Well I just can't see
But there isn't no peace to found
But if someone really cared
Well they would take the time to spare
A moment to try and understand
Another one's despair
Remember in this
Game we call life
That no one said it's fair


Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Yeah
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Breakdown
Let me hear it now
Get down with yo' bad self
Alright


I have come to know the cold
I think of it as home
When there isn't enough of me
To go around
I would rather be left alone
But if I call you out of habit
I am out of love and I gotta have it
Would you give it to me
If I fit you needs
Like when we both knew we had it
But now the damage is done
And we are back out on the run
Fun how everything was roses
When we held on to the guns
Just because you are winning
Don't mean you are the lucky ones




There goes the Challenger
Being chased
By the blue blue
Eanies on wheels
The vicious traffic
Squad cars are
After our lone driver
The last American hero
The-the electric sintar
The demi-god
The super driver
Of the golden west
Two nasty nazi cars
Are close behind
The beautiful lone driver
The police cars are getting
Closer closer
Closer to our soul hero in his
Soul mobile yeah baby
They about to strike
They gonna get him
Smash rape
The last beautiful free
Soul on this planet

Always done before


My hands are tied
The billions shift
From side to side
And the wars go
On with brainwashed pride
For the love of god
And our human rights
And all these things
Are swept aside
By bloody hands
Time can't deny
And are washed
Away by your genocide
And history hides the
Lies of our civil wars


D'you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said peace
Could last forever
And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
I went numb when
I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of
D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom
When it's not in your hands
When everybody's fighting
For their promised land


And I don't need
Your civil war
It feeds the rich while
It buries the poor
Your power hungry

In a human grocery store
Isn't that fresh
I don't need your civil war

You're filling
Look at the blood
We're spilling
Look at the world
We're killing
The way we've
Always done before
Look in the doubt
We've wallowed
Look at the leaders
We've followed
Look at the lies
We've swallowed
And I don't want
To hear no more


My hands are tied
For all I've seen has
Changed my mind
But still the wars go on
As the years go by
With no love of god
Or human rights
Cause all these dreams
Are swept aside
By bloody hands
Of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross
Of homicide
And history bears the scars
Of our civil wars


We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and Government officials
For example, we create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer


I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while
It buries the poor

And I don't think I want to
Ever come back to this... world again
Kinda like it in a coma
Because no one's ever going to
Oh, make me come back to this... world again


Now I feel as if I'm floating away
I can't feel all the pressure
And I like it this way
But my body's calling
My body's calling
Won't you come back to this... world again

Suspended deep in a sea of black
I've got the light at the end
I've got the bones on the mast
Well, I've gone sailing
I've gone sailing
I could leave so easily
While friends are
Calling back to me
I said they're, they're
Leavin' it all up to me
When all I needed was clarity, and
Someone to tell me
What the fuck is going on

Goddamn it


Slipping farther and farther away
It's a miracle, how long we can stay
In a world our minds created
In a world that's full of shit

Help me
""Okay, let's get this guy in the program please, we're losing him."" ""Start an IV Please.""
Help Me
""Come on... His airways.. someone's got to protect his airways. I want two...""
""Where's the defibrillator?""
""Two IV's over here please. That's two more now. We're losing him""

I'm climbing through
The wreckage
Of all my twisted dreams
But this cheap investigation
Just can't stifle all my screams
And I'm waiting
At the crossroads
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Where are you

No one's going to
Bother me anymore
No one's going to mess
With my head no more
I can't understand what
All the fightin's for
But it's so nice here
Down off the shore
I wish you could see this
Because there's nothing to see
It's peaceful here
And it's fine with me
Not like the world where
I used to live
I never really wanted to live


I know
""Okay, we're starting to lose this guy. I want that IV and his airway protected!""
""Let's get some people in here!""
""Get the crash cart please, we're losing this guy. He's going..."" ""Give me an airway please""
""... Going under.""

You live your life like it's a coma
Won't you tell me why we'd wanna
With all the reasons you give it's
It's kinda hard to believe
But who am I to tell you that I've seen
Any reason why you should stay
Maybe we'd be better off without you, anyway

You got a one way ticket
On your last chance ride
Gotta one way ticket
To your suicide
Gotta one way ticket
And there's no way out alive

An all this crass communication
That has left you in the cold
Isn't much for consolation
When you feel so weak and old
But if home is where the heart is
Then there's stories to be told
No, you don't need a doctor
No one else can heal your soul

Got your mind in submission
Got your life on the line
But nobody pulled the trigger
They just stepped aside
They be down by the water
While you, watch them waving goodbye

They be calling in the morning
They be hanging on the phone
They be waiting for an answer
But you know nobody's home
When the bell's stopped ringing
It was, nobody's fault but your own

There were always ample warnings
There were always subtle signs
And you would have seen it coming
But we gave you too much time

And when you said that no one's listening
Why'd your best friend drop a dime
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting
For a way to spend our time

And ""it's so easy"" to be social
""It's so easy"" to be cool
Yeah, it's easy to be hungry
When you ain't got shit to lose

And I wish that I could help you
With what you hope to find
But I'm still out here waiting
Watching reruns of my life

Know it's gonna take some time

A piece of my mind
Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
Cause I've been
Where I have been
And I've seen
What I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
Cause it's all a part of me

Be it a song
Or casual conversation
To hold my tongue speaks
Of quiet reservations
Your words once heard
They can place you in a faction
My words may disturb but
At least there's a reaction

Sometimes I wanna kill
Sometimes I wanna die
Sometimes I wanna destroy
Sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I could get even
Sometimes I could give up
Sometimes I could give
Sometimes I never give a fuck

It's only for a while
I hope you understand
I never wanted this to happen
Didn't want to be a man
So I hid inside my world
I took what I could find
I cried when I was lonely
I fell down when I was blind

Don't damn me when I speak
A piece of my mind
Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
Cause I've been
Where I have been
And I've seen
What I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
Cause it's all a part of me

How can I ever satisfy you
And how can
I ever make you see
That deep inside
We're all somebody
And it don't matter
Who you wanna be

But now I gotta smile
I hope you comprehend
For this man can say it happened
Cause this child
Has been condemned
So I stepped into your world
I kicked you in the mind
And I'm the only witness to
The nature of my crime

But look at what we've done
To the innocent and young
Whoa listen to
Who's talkingcause
We're not the only ones
The trash collected by the eyes
And dumped into the brain
Said it tears into
Our conscious thoughts
You tell me, who's to blame

I know you don't
Wanna hear me cryin'
And I know you don't
Wanna hear me deny
That your satisfaction
Lies in your illusion
But your delusions
Are yours and not mine

We take for granted
We know the whole story
We judge a book by its cover
And read what we want
Between selected lines

Don't hail me and
Don't idolize the ink
Or I've failed in my attentions
Can you find the missing link
Your only validation
Is living your own life
Vicarious existence is
A fucking waste of time

So I send this song
To the offended
I said what I meant and
I've never pretended
As so many others do
Intending just to please
If I damned your point of view
Could you turn the other cheek

Don't damn me when I speak
A piece of my mind
Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
Cause I've been
Where I have been
And I've seen
What I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
Cause it's all a part of me

Don't damn me
I said don't damn me
I said don't hail me
Don't damn me

I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith

And I was round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made

I shouted out
""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all
It was you and me

Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

Please to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
Cause I'm in need of some restraint

So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game",rock,,,,Rolling Stones,"Paint It, Black",http://genius.com/The-rolling-stones-paint-it-black-lyrics,"I see a red door and I want it painted black

With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a new born baby, it just happens every day



I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black


No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
