{Roger Daltrey}
Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight to prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven

Don't cry, don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

Sally, take my hand, we'll travel south 'cross land
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here,the happy ones are near
Let's get togetherbefore we get much older

Teenage wasteland, oh, oh

1,The Who,Won't Get Fooled Again,http://genius.com/The-who-wont-get-fooled-again-lyrics,"We'll be fighting in the streets
With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgment of all wrong
They decide and the shotgun sings the song

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around me
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
And I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again

Change it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold that's all
But the world looks just the same
And history ain't changed
Cause the banners, they all flown in the last war

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around me
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
And I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
No, no!

I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
For I know that the hypnotized never lie

Do ya?

There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
And the parting on the left
Is now the parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around me
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again
No, no!

2,The Who,Behind Blue Eyes,http://genius.com/The-who-behind-blue-eyes-lyrics,"No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man, to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

No one knows what it's like
To be hated, to be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings like I do
And I blame you

No one bites back as hard
On their anger, none of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool

And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

3,The Who,Who Are You,http://genius.com/The-who-who-are-you-lyrics,"I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said ""You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away""
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair


Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)


I took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rolling Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin
I stretched back and I hiccupped
And looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan
God, there's got to be another way
Who are you?
Oh wa oh wa oh wa oh wa






I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
I only feel right on my knees
I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothing like him

Sure plays a mean pinball

He stands like a statue
Becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean
Plays by intuition
The digit counters fall
Thatdeaf, dumb, and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's
Got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it?
I don't know!
What makes him so good?

Ain't got no distractions
Can't hear no buzzers and bells
Don't see no lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay
Never seen him fall
Thatdeaf, dumb, and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

I thought I was
The Bally table king
But I just handed
My pinball crown to him

Even on my favorite table
He can beat my best
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers

Free frustration in our minds and our toes
Quiet storm water,m-m-my generation

Nowhere is home

Out of my brain on the train
Out of my brain on the train

Slowly sinking
Back of alorry
Holy hitching

Greyly outrageous in my high heel shoes
Tightly undone, know what they're showing
Sadly ecstatic that their heros are news

Father was the contents
Of atest tubein the ice box
In the factory of birth
My name is 905
And I've just become alive
I'm the newest populator
Of the planet we call Earth


In suspended animation
My childhood passed me by
If I speak without emotion
Then you know the reason why
Knowledge of the universe
Was fed into my mind
As my adolescent body
Left its puberty behind


And everything I know is what I need to know
And everything I do's been done before
Every sentence in my head
Someone else has said
At each end of my life is an open door


Automatically defrosted
When manhood came on time
I became a man
I left the""ice school""behind
Now I'm to begin
The life that I'm assigned
A life that's been used before
A thousand times


I have a feeling deep inside
That somethin' is missing
It's a feeling in my soul
And I can't help wishing
That one day I'll discover
That we're living a lie
And I'll tell the whole world
The reason why

Sickness can surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know


A vague haze of delirium
Creeps up on me
All at once a tall stranger
I suddenly see
He's dressed in a silver-sparked
Glittering gown
And his golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground

Nothing to say, and nothing to hear
And nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note
In my symphony

That transmit all they know
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide

I want to scream in the night, I want a manifest
I've got that wide awake, give-and-take, five o'clock-in-the-morning feeling
I've got the hots for the sluts in the well thumbed pages of a magazine
I want to drive, want to fly like I do in the dreams I've never really been in
I want to hump, want to jump, want to heat up, cool down in a dream machine


I'm dreaming from the waist on down
I'm dreaming but I feel tired and bound
I'm dreaming of a day when a cold shower helps my health
I'm dreaming dreaming - of the day I can control myself
Day I can control myself


Sound like a priest and then I'm shooting dice
I'm burning tires with some guy whose hair is turning white
I know the girls that I pass, they just ain't impressed
I'm too old to give up, but too young to rest
I've got that numb-to-a-thumb over-dubbed
Feeling social when the world is sleeping
The plot starts to thicken then I sicken and I feel I'm cemented down
I'm so juiced that the whorey lady's sad sad story has me quietly weeping
But here comes the morning
Here comes the yawning demented clown


I'm dreaming but I know it's all hot air
I'm dreaming I'll get back to that rocking chair
I'm dreaming of the day I can share the wealth
I'm dreaming, dreaming - of the day I can control myself
Day I can control myself
Hey, hey!
The day I can control myself",rock

I ain't seen a sign of my hero

Let me flow into the ocean
Let me get back to the sea
Let me be stormy, let me be calm
Let the tide in and set me free

I'm flowing under bridges
Then flying through the sky
I'm travelling down cold metal
Just a tear in baby's eye

I am not the actor
This can't be the scene
But I am in the water

I'm remembering distant memories
Recalling other names
Rippling over canyons
And boiling in the train

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it makes me wonder


There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking




And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter


If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady,can you hear the wind blow,and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind




And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll


And she's buying the stairway to heaven",rock

To sit with elders of the gentle race, this world has seldom seen
They talk of days for which they sit and wait

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate, the story was quite clear

I've been flying, ain't no denying, no denying

As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Heed the path that led me to that place, yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds,fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear

Oh, the songs to sing, when we at last return again
Sending off a glancing kiss, to those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil's in his hole
Oh to sail away, To sandy lands and other days
Oh to touch the dream, Hides inside and never seen
Into the sun the south the north, at last the birds have flown
The shackles of commitment fell, In pieces on the ground
Oh to ride the wind, To tread the air above the din
Oh to laugh aloud, Dancing as we fought the crowd
To seek the man whose pointing hand, The giant step unfolds
With guidance from the curving path, That churns up into stone
If one bell should ring, in celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat, As proud the head with heavy feet
Days went by when you and I, bathed in eternal summers glow
As far away and distant, Our mutual child did grow
Oh the sweet refrain, Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh Albion remains, sleeping now to rise again
Wandering &amp; wandering, What place to rest the search
The mighty arms of Atlas, Hold the heavens from the earth

From the earth

Smoked my stuffand drank, all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching, in my heart
Someone told methere's a girl out there
With love in her eyesand flowers, in her hair

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow, could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
Asthe children of the sunbegan to awake
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high


To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems...",rock

Pray for the other ones

And it's a world of dread and fear


Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears


And thethat ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom


Well tonight thank God it's them

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life(Oooh)

Ain't no mistaking, my body's shaking
My soul's been taken
By a Devil with a New Disguise
The girl's so witching, my backbone's twitching
Because down in Hell's kitchen
The Devil's got a New Disguise


If you see Kay, tell her I love her
She did me in but I'll recover
She said love was her desire
All that she touched she set on fire
She was so diss - I couldn't slay her
She blew a kiss - I threw the dagger




She came from the wrong side of town
Everytime she got off she gets knocked back down
She's Heaven materialized
She's giving me Hell but it ain't no suprise
She's a bit uncivilized",rock

We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world

Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard


But when you're
There's ayour window
And it's a world of dread and fear


Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears


And thethat ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom


Well tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you


And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life(Oooh)
Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?


Here's to you


Raise a glass for everyone


Here's to them


Underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Checkmate honey, you're the only one who's got ta choose

And I told him what I'd done
Said you'd best go on a diet
Yeah I hope you have some fun
And a'don't go burst a bubble
On the rich folks who get rude
Cause you won't get in no trouble
When you eats that kinda food
Now their smokin' up the junk bonds
And then they go get stiff
And they're dancin' in the yacht club
With Muff and Uncle Biff
But there's one good thing that happens
When you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit
But go real good with wine




Believe in all the good things
That money just can't buy
Then you won't get no belly ache
From eatin' humble pie
I believe in rags to riches
Your inheritence won't last
So take your Grey Poupon my friend
And shove it up your ass!

Hanging off her legs
She threw me on the bed
Her hand went for my throat
As I began to choke
She said, Honey shoot your load

Baby I got my eye on you
But you do all the things that I want you to
Stop your crying and dry your tears
I isn’t that wet behind the ears

Why you're being so unkind?
Remember those nights you spent alone
Talking on the telephone?
Thoughts of you go through my brain
You told me that you felt the same
You told me that you love me too
Tell me who would lie with you?


I was talking birds
And you was talking bees
And he was down upon his knees
Beating around the bush


You're the meanest woman I've ever known
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
I know what you're looking for
You ate your cake, you want some more

Done everything I'm going to do

In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day
And the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried


Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew


In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the Earth is old and grey, little darling we'll away
But my love this cannot be
Oh so many years are gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

Don't you hear me calling you
All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand

No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death


Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say


Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
Its good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell",rock

There'll be no more AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe its working. Good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go


There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look and it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
And I … have become comfortably numb

Hey you out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?

Hey you with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

As you can see
No matter how he tried
He could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

Always doing what you're told

Listen son, said the man with the gun
There's room for you inside

So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock, they won't do it again
Dig it? I mean he get off lightly
Cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of opinion
But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?

Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!

You cried for the moon

Threatened by shadows at night

No warmth, not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you

Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbors turn away
And there’s a change that, even with regret, cannot be undone

Now frontiers shift like desert sands
While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of grey

As darkness falls
The waves roll by
The seasons change
The wind is wry

Now wakes the hour
Now sleeps the swan
Behold the dream
The dream is gone
Green fields are calling
It’s falling, in a golden door

And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds
And I go down

Just trying to kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today

To lay it on the line

Do you need some time... all alone
Everybody needs some time... on their own

But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you

Sometimes I need some time... all alone
Everybody needs some time... on their own
Don't you know you need some time... all alone

And shadows still remain
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
Cause nothin' lasts forever

Look at the fear

Look at the lives

Always done before

The billions shift
From side to side
And the wars go
On with brainwashed pride
For the love of god
And our human rights
And all these things
Are swept aside
By bloody hands
Time can't deny
And are washed
Away by your genocide
And history hides the
Lies of our civil wars


D'you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said peace
Could last forever
And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
I went numb when
I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of
D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom
When it's not in your hands
When everybody's fighting
For their promised land

Your civil war
It feeds the rich while
It buries the poor
Your power hungry
Selling soldiers
In a human grocery store
Isn't that fresh
I don't need your civil war

You're filling
Look at the blood
We're spilling
Look at the world
We're killing
The way we've
Always done before
Look in the doubt
We've wallowed
Look at the leaders
We've followed
Look at the lies
We've swallowed
And I don't want
To hear no more


My hands are tied
For all I've seen has
Changed my mind
But still the wars go on
As the years go by
With no love of god
Or human rights
Cause all these dreams
Are swept aside
By bloody hands
Of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross
Of homicide
And history bears the scars
Of our civil wars


We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and Government officials
For example, we create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer


I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while
It buries the poor
Your power hungry

In a human grocery store

Back off, back off bitch
Down in the gutter
Dying in the ditch
You better back off
Back off bitch
Face of an angel with
The love of a witch
Back off, back off bitch
Back off, back off bitch


Making love
Cheap heartbreaker
Broken backed
Nasty ballbreaker
Stay out of
My bed, outta my head
If it's loving you
I'm better off dead




Emotions ripped
Gone on a binge
Life lipped, I said
You're off the hinge
Telling lies of such
Fame and glory
I don't even want to
Hear your story




Hey what do you think he's trying
To say there, anyway
I think it's something
Each person's
Supposed to take in
Their own special way

227,Guns N' Roses,Better,http://genius.com/Guns-n-roses-better-lyrics,"No one ever told me when
I was alone
They just thought I'd know better, better


The hardest part
This troubled heart
Has never yet been through now

Was heal the scars
That got their start
Inside someone like you now

For had I known
Or I'd been shown
Back when how long it'd take me

To break the charms
That brought me harm
And all but would erase me

I never would
Or thought I could
No matter what you'd pay me

Replay the part
You stole my heart
I should have known you're crazy

If all I knew
Was that with you
I'd want someone to save me

It'd be enough
But just my luck
I fell in love and maybe

All that I wanted was


Now I know you better
You know I know better
Now I know you better


So bittersweet
This tragedy
Won't ask for absolution

This melody
Inside of me
Still searches for solution

A twist of faith
A change of heart
Cures my infatuation

A broken heart
Provides the spark
For my determination



All that I wanted was




I never wanted you to be so full of anger (anger)
I never wanted you to be somebody else
I never wanted you to be someone afraid to know themselves
I only wanted you to see things for yourself

All that I wanted was


Now I know you better
Now we all know better
All that I wanted was

Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na

If I were you
I'd manage to
Avoid the invitation

Of promised love
That can't keep up
With your adoration

Just use your head
And in the end
You'll find your inspiration

To choose your steps
And won't regret
This kind of aggravation

We come down from the wire
An everybody warms themselves
To a different fire
When sometimes we get burned
You would think sometime we could learn
The one you love is the one
That should take you higher
You have got no one
You better go back
Out and find her


Just like children hiding in a closet
Can't tell what is going on outside
Sometimes we are so far
Off the beaten track
We will get taken for a ride
By a parlor trick or
Some words of wit
A hidden hand up a sleeve
To think the one you love
Could hurt you now
Is a little hard to believe
But everybody darling sometimes
Bites the hand that feeds


When I look around
Everybody always
Brings me down
Well is it them or me
Well I just can't see
But there isn't no peace to found
But if someone really cared
Well they would take the time to spare
A moment to try and understand
Another one's despair
Remember in this
Game we call life
That no one said it's fair

I think of it as home
When there isn't enough of me
To go around
I would rather be left alone
But if I call you out of habit
I am out of love and I gotta have it
Would you give it to me
If I fit you needs

But now the damage is done
And we are back out on the run
Fun how everything was roses
When we held on to the guns
Just because you are winning
Don't mean you are the lucky ones




There goes the Challenger
Being chased
By the blue blue
Eanies on wheels
The vicious traffic
Squad cars are
After our lone driver
The last American hero
The-the electric sintar
The demi-god
The super driver
Of the golden west
Two nasty nazi cars
Are close behind
The beautiful lone driver
The police cars are getting
Closer closer
Closer to our soul hero in his

They about to strike
They gonna get him

On with brainwashed pride
For the love of god

And all these things
Are swept aside
By bloody hands
Time can't deny
And are washed
Away by your genocide
And history hides the
Lies of our civil wars

Could last forever
And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy

Look at the leaders
We've followed
Look at the lies
We've swallowed
And I don't want
To hear no more


My hands are tied
For all I've seen has
Changed my mind
But still the wars go on
As the years go by
With no love of god
Or human rights
Cause all these dreams
Are swept aside
By bloody hands
Of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross
Of homicide
And history bears the scars
Of our civil wars


We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and Government officials
For example, we create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer

I can't feel all the pressure
And I like it this way
But my body's calling
My body's calling
Won't you come back to this... world again

Suspended deep in a sea of black
I've got the light at the end
I've got the bones on the mast
Well, I've gone sailing
I've gone sailing
I could leave so easily
While friends are
Calling back to me
I said they're, they're
Leavin' it all up to me
When all I needed was clarity, and
Someone to tell me
What the fuck is going on

Goddamn it


Slipping farther and farther away
It's a miracle, how long we can stay
In a world our minds created
In a world that's full of shit

The wreckage
Of all my twisted dreams

Just can't stifle all my screams
And I'm waiting
At the crossroads
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Where are you

No one's going to
Bother me anymore
No one's going to mess
With my head no more
I can't understand what
All the fightin's for
But it's so nice here
Down off the shore
I wish you could see this
Because there's nothing to see
It's peaceful here
And it's fine with me
Not like the world where
I used to live
I never really wanted to live

When you feel so weak and old
But if home is where the heart is
Then there's stories to be told
No, you don't need a doctor
No one else can heal your soul

Got your mind in submission
Got your life on the line
But nobody pulled the trigger
They just stepped aside
They be down by the water
While you, watch them waving goodbye

They be calling in the morning
They be hanging on the phone
They be waiting for an answer
But you know nobody's home
When the bell's stopped ringing
It was, nobody's fault but your own

There were always ample warnings
There were always subtle signs
And you would have seen it coming
But we gave you too much time

And when you said that no one's listening
Why'd your best friend drop a dime
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting
For a way to spend our time

And ""it's so easy"" to be social
""It's so easy"" to be cool
Yeah, it's easy to be hungry
When you ain't got shit to lose

And I wish that I could help you
With what you hope to find

Know it's gonna take some time

Where I have been
And I've seen
What I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
Cause it's all a part of me

Be it a song
Or casual conversation
To hold my tongue speaks
Of quiet reservations
Your words once heard
They can place you in a faction
My words may disturb but
At least there's a reaction

Sometimes I wanna die
Sometimes I wanna destroy
Sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I could get even
Sometimes I could give up
Sometimes I could give
Sometimes I never give a fuck

I hope you understand
I never wanted this to happen
Didn't want to be a man
So I hid inside my world
I took what I could find
I cried when I was lonely
I fell down when I was blind

Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
Cause I've been
Where I have been

And how can
I ever make you see

We're all somebody
And it don't matter
Who you wanna be

But now I gotta smile
I hope you comprehend
For this man can say it happened
Cause this child
Has been condemned
So I stepped into your world
I kicked you in the mind
And I'm the only witness to
The nature of my crime

But look at what we've done
To the innocent and young
Whoa listen to
Who's talkingcause
We're not the only ones
The trash collected by the eyes
And dumped into the brain
Said it tears into
Our conscious thoughts
You tell me, who's to blame

I know you don't
Wanna hear me cryin'
And I know you don't
Wanna hear me deny
That your satisfaction
Lies in your illusion
But your delusions
Are yours and not mine

We take for granted
We know the whole story
We judge a book by its cover
And read what we want
Between selected lines

Don't hail me and
Don't idolize the ink
Or I've failed in my attentions
Can you find the missing link
Your only validation
Is living your own life
Vicarious existence is
A fucking waste of time

So I send this song
To the offended
I said what I meant and
I've never pretended
As so many others do
Intending just to please
If I damned your point of view
Could you turn the other cheek

Don't damn me when I speak
A piece of my mind
Cause silence isn't golden
When I'm holding it inside
Cause I've been
Where I have been
And I've seen
What I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
Cause it's all a part of me

Don't damn me

I said don't hail me

I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith

And I was round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made

I shouted out
""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all
It was you and me

Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

Please to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
Cause I'm in need of some restraint

So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue

The lady she all dressed me up in roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

268,Rolling Stones,Dead Flowers prod. by Jimmy Miller,http://genius.com/The-rolling-stones-dead-flowers-lyrics,"Well, when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair
Talking to some rich folk that you know
Well, I hope you won't see me in my ragged company
Well, you know I could never be alone


Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can send medead flowersevery morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave


Well, when you're sitting back in your rose pink Cadillac
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day
Ah, I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon
And another girl can take my pain away

They chased a boy right through the park
And in a case of mistaken identity
The put a bullet through his heart
Heart breakers with your forty four
I want to tear your world apart
You heart breaker with your forty four
I want to tear your world a part
A ten year old girl on a street corner
Sticking needles in her arm
She died in the dirt of an alleyway
Her mother said she had no chance, no chance!


Heart breaker, heart breaker

She stuck the pins right in her heart
Heart breaker, pain maker
Stole the love right out of you heart
Heart breaker, heart breaker
You stole the love right out of my heart




I wanna tear your world apart
Doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo...",rock
